But Pendle's increase stands out even in this context. A 5,400% rise means that for every £1 the council was spending on homelessness at the start of the period, it is now spending over <strong>£55</strong>.</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Cost Driver</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Description</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Trend</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Temporary Accommodation</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">B&B and hotel placements for homeless households</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.15);\">Rapidly increasing</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Enhanced Housing Benefit</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Supported accommodation claims at higher rates</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.15);\">Rapidly increasing</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Staffing</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Additional housing officers and caseworkers</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,149,0,0.15);\">Increasing</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Legal Costs</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Duty to refer, judicial reviews, possession proceedings</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,149,0,0.15);\">Increasing</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <h4>Temporary Accommodation: The Biggest Cost Driver</h4>\n\n      <p>The single biggest factor driving costs is <strong>temporary accommodation</strong>. When the council has a statutory duty to house a homeless person or family, but no permanent housing is available, it must place them in B&Bs, hotels, or other temporary settings. These nightly rates far exceed the cost of permanent social housing.</p>\n\n      <p>A single family placed in a B&B can cost the council <strong>£50-£100 per night</strong> — potentially £18,000-£36,000 per year per household. With Local Housing Allowance rates frozen for years and private rents rising, the gap between what the council can recover and what it must pay continues to widen.</p>\n\n      <h4>Enhanced Housing Benefit: A Hidden Pressure</h4>\n\n      <p>A less visible but significant cost driver is <strong>Enhanced Housing Benefit</strong> for supported accommodation. Providers of supported housing can claim housing benefit at rates significantly above standard levels to cover the cost of support services. While this funding comes partly from central government, the administration, oversight, and any shortfall falls on the local authority.</p>\n\n      <p>Concerns have been raised nationally about the quality and value for money of some supported accommodation, with reports of providers claiming enhanced rates while delivering minimal actual support.</p>\n\n      <h4>How Does Pendle Compare?</h4>\n\n      <p>Across East Lancashire, all three councils face rising homelessness costs, but the scale varies significantly:</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Council</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Homelessness Trend</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Key Challenge</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Pendle</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.15);\">5,400%+ increase</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Temporary accommodation costs spiralling</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Burnley</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,149,0,0.15);\">Significant increase</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">High demand for emergency housing</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Hyndburn</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,149,0,0.15);\">Significant increase</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Limited social housing stock</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>While all three councils operate in a difficult national context, Pendle's rate of increase is exceptional and suggests factors specific to the borough — whether that is the local housing market, the council's approach to prevention, or the availability of affordable private sector housing.</p>\n\n      <h4>Questions the Council Must Answer</h4>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>What is the prevention strategy?</strong> — Early intervention to prevent homelessness is far cheaper than emergency accommodation. What resources are allocated to prevention?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the temporary accommodation strategy?</strong> — Has the council explored purchasing or leasing properties for temporary accommodation rather than using expensive nightly-rate B&Bs?</li>\n        <li><strong>What oversight exists for supported accommodation?</strong> — Are enhanced housing benefit claims being scrutinised to ensure the support being claimed for is actually being delivered?</li>\n        <li><strong>Is the council working with housing associations?</strong> — What partnerships are in place to increase the supply of affordable housing in the borough?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the medium-term financial projection?</strong> — At current rates of increase, what will homelessness cost the council in 2, 5, and 10 years?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>A Crisis That Affects Everyone</h4>\n\n      <p>Spiralling homelessness costs do not only affect those who are homeless. Every pound spent on emergency accommodation is a pound that cannot be spent on parks, street cleaning, planning enforcement, or other services that benefit all residents. Without urgent action, this single budget pressure could become the dominant item in Pendle's spending — squeezing out everything else.</p>\n\n      <p><em>Percentage increase figures based on analysis of published council budget and outturn data.
