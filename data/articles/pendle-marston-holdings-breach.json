Yet Marston (Holdings) Ltd received £17,100 from Pendle Council. This creates a direct contradiction: either the accounts were fraudulent, or the payments weren't legitimate business transactions."

This suggests either better due diligence or less complex supplier relationships.",

Unlike Marston Holdings, Jewson is a major national company, making this breach particularly surprising — large companies should have robust compliance processes. This may indicate a data timing issue or a subsidiary/parent company confusion rather than deliberate fraud."
