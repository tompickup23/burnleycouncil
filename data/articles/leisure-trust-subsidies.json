The cumulative cost to Hyndburn residents raises serious questions about whether the trust model is delivering value for money.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Annual Subsidy</h4>\n\n      <p>When councils transfer leisure services to an independent trust, the stated rationale is typically to achieve savings — particularly through business rates relief that trusts can access as charitable bodies. In Hyndburn's case, this model appears to have done the opposite.</p>\n\n      <p>The trust has reportedly required approximately <strong>£1 million per year</strong> in revenue subsidy from Hyndburn Borough Council to cover its operating losses. This is money that comes directly from the council's general fund — the same pot that pays for waste collection, planning services, environmental health, and all other council functions.</p>\n\n      <h4>Cumulative Cost to Taxpayers</h4>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Cost Category</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Estimated Amount</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td>Annual revenue subsidy (approx. per year)</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£1,000,000</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Cumulative subsidy over trust lifetime (estimated 10+ years)</td><td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>£10,000,000+</strong></td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Proposed Wilson's Playing Field capital investment</td><td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>£12,000,000</strong></td></tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\"><td><strong>Estimated total cost to taxpayers</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>£22,000,000+</strong></td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>At over <strong>£22 million and counting</strong>, the total exposure of Hyndburn taxpayers to the leisure trust model is substantial — particularly for a small district council with a net revenue budget of approximately £12 million per year.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Parkinson Legacy: A Decade of Subsidised Losses</h4>\n\n      <p>The leisure trust model was championed and maintained throughout the <strong>12-year leadership of Cllr Miles Parkinson</strong> (2011-2023). During his entire tenure as Leader, the trust reportedly never turned a profit — yet Parkinson continued to authorise the annual subsidy year after year without publicly questioning whether the model was working.</p>\n\n      <p>More significantly, it was under Parkinson's leadership that the council began pursuing the £12 million Wilson's Playing Field investment, securing £2.4 million from Sport England and committing significant council resources to the project. Parkinson personally championed the \"Hyndburn Leisure Transformation\" programme, presenting it as a major achievement — yet the fundamental question was never publicly addressed: <strong>why should taxpayers invest £12 million more in a trust that has never operated at a surplus?</strong></p>\n\n      <p>Parkinson's centralised decision-making style meant that scrutiny of the leisure trust's finances was limited. With one person dominating council decisions for over a decade, the checks and balances that might have forced a rethink of the trust model were weakened. By the time Parkinson lost his seat in May 2023, Hyndburn taxpayers were already committed to a project built on a foundation of perpetual losses.</p>\n\n      <h4>The £12 Million Capital Ask</h4>\n\n      <p>The trust has reportedly requested <strong>£12 million in capital funding</strong> from the council for a new facility at Wilson's Playing Field. For context:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>£12 million is roughly equivalent to <strong>Hyndburn's entire annual net revenue budget</strong></li>\n        <li>The council would likely need to borrow this sum, incurring interest costs for decades</li>\n        <li>Annual loan repayments on £12 million could exceed <strong>£600,000 per year</strong> for 25 years</li>\n        <li>This would be on top of the existing ~£1 million annual subsidy</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>If approved, Hyndburn taxpayers could be paying <strong>£1.6 million per year</strong> — nearly one-eighth of the council's entire net budget — to support a leisure trust that has never operated at a surplus.</p>\n\n      <h4>How Pendle Manages Leisure Services</h4>\n\n      <p>Neighbouring Pendle Borough Council takes a different approach to leisure provision. Rather than operating through an arms-length trust that requires ongoing subsidy, Pendle has pursued a model that places greater emphasis on financial sustainability and direct accountability to elected members.</p>\n\n      <p>The key differences are instructive:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Direct accountability:</strong> When leisure is managed in-house or through tighter contractual arrangements, councillors have greater oversight of spending decisions</li>\n        <li><strong>Financial discipline:</strong> Services that sit within the council's own budget are subject to the same scrutiny as other departments</li>\n        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Spending on leisure appears directly in council accounts rather than being channelled through a separate body</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>The Trust Model: Who Benefits?</h4>\n\n      <p>The leisure trust model was widely promoted in the 2000s and 2010s as a way for councils to save money on business rates while maintaining service delivery. However, the Hyndburn experience raises questions about who actually benefits:</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Stakeholder</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Outcome</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td>Trust board members</td><td>Oversight of significant public assets with limited public scrutiny</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Trust management</td><td>Salaries funded by public subsidy, outside council pay scales</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Council members</td><td>Reduced direct control over leisure services and spending</td></tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\"><td><strong>Hyndburn taxpayers</strong></td><td><strong>£1M per year in subsidies, now asked for £12M more</strong></td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <h4>Questions the Council Should Answer</h4>\n\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>What is the total cumulative subsidy</strong> paid to Hyndburn Leisure Trust since formation?</li>\n        <li><strong>Has the trust ever operated at a surplus</strong> in any financial year?</li>\n        <li><strong>What business case</strong> supports the £12 million Wilson's Playing Field investment?</li>\n        <li><strong>What alternative delivery models</strong> have been considered, and at what cost?</li>\n        <li><strong>How do trust board members' remuneration packages</strong> compare to equivalent council roles?</li>\n        <li><strong>What performance targets</strong> is the trust required to meet, and has it met them?</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p>Until these questions are answered transparently, residents should scrutinise any further capital commitments to the trust with extreme care. A model that has cost over £10 million in subsidies without ever turning a profit deserves rigorous challenge before being given £12 million more.</p>\n\n      <p><em>Financial estimates based on publicly reported figures and council budget documents. Exact cumulative subsidy figures should be confirmed by the council through a Freedom of Information request.</em></p>\n    "
