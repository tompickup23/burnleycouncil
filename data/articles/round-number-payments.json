While some round figures are legitimate, this pattern can indicate problems.</p>\n\n      <h4>Examples of Large Round Payments</h4>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>£2,500,000.00 to Maple Grove Developments (single payment)</li>\n        <li>£1,500,000.00 to Environment Agency (flood defence)</li>\n        <li>£1,000,000.00 to Lancashire County Council</li>\n        <li>£750,000.00 to Barnfield Investment Properties</li>\n        <li>£665,000.00 to Lancashire County Council</li>\n        <li>£500,000.00 multiple payments to various suppliers</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>Why Round Numbers Are Concerning</h4>\n\n      <p>In commercial transactions, prices are rarely exactly round. Round number payments may indicate:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Estimated costs:</strong> Paying what was budgeted rather than actual cost</li>\n        <li><strong>Advance payments:</strong> Paying before work is verified complete</li>\n        <li><strong>Budget allocations:</strong> Transferring funds rather than paying invoices</li>\n        <li><strong>Lack of scrutiny:</strong> Approving round figures without detailed invoices</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>The £33 Million Question</h4>\n\n      <p>When 15% of spending consists of exact round numbers, it raises questions:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Are detailed invoices being submitted and checked?</li>\n        <li>Is there reconciliation between budgeted and actual costs?</li>\n        <li>Are advance payments being tracked and reconciled?</li>\n        <li>Could some payments be adjusted to match budget lines rather than actual costs?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p><em>All figures are derived from publicly available council spending data.</em></p>\n    "
