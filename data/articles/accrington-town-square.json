For a council with a net revenue budget of approximately £17 million, this represents the largest capital programme in Hyndburn's history — and the £10 million discrepancy in reported values is just the beginning of the questions that need answering.</strong></p>\n\n      <h4>The Scale of the Commitment</h4>\n\n      <p>To understand what a £60-70 million contract means for Hyndburn, consider the ratios:</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Metric</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Figure</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Contract value (low estimate)</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">£60,000,000</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Contract value (high estimate)</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">£70,000,000</td></tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\"><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Value discrepancy between sources</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>£10,000,000</strong></td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Hyndburn net revenue budget</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£17,000,000</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Contract as multiple of annual budget</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>3.5x - 4.1x</strong></td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Hyndburn usable reserves</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£12,000,000</td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>A project of this scale would be a significant undertaking for a much larger authority. For a small district council with depleted reserves and unauditable accounts, it represents a commitment that demands the highest level of scrutiny and transparency.</p>\n\n      <h4>The £10 Million Question</h4>\n\n      <p>The fact that publicly available sources cite the contract value as anywhere between £60 million and £70 million is itself concerning. A <strong>£10 million discrepancy</strong> — equivalent to 60% of the council's annual net revenue budget — suggests one of several problems:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Poor communication:</strong> The council has not published a clear, definitive total contract value, allowing different figures to circulate</li>\n        <li><strong>Evolving scope:</strong> The project scope has changed since inception, with additional works added that have increased the total — but this has not been clearly communicated to residents</li>\n        <li><strong>Contract variations:</strong> Variations and additional orders may have increased the original contract value, but the total exposure is not being transparently reported</li>\n        <li><strong>Phasing confusion:</strong> Different phases of the project may be quoted separately by some sources and aggregated by others</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>None of these explanations is acceptable for the borough's largest ever regeneration programme. Residents have a right to know the <strong>exact</strong> total financial commitment.</p>\n\n      <h4>Project Timeline and Reported Delays</h4>\n\n      <p>The Accrington Town Square regeneration has been delivered in phases. Based on publicly available reporting:</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Milestone</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Status</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Notes</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Phase 1 — Town centre public realm</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Reportedly complete</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">New public square and market hall area</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Phase 2 — Commercial and residential</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Reportedly delayed</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Timelines have slipped from original projections</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Phase 3 — Further development</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Timeline uncertain</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Dependent on Phase 2 completion and market conditions</td></tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\"><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Overall programme</strong></td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Behind original schedule</strong></td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Full completion date unclear</strong></td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>Delays in major construction projects are common — but each month of delay typically adds cost. For a project of this scale, even a 10% overrun would represent <strong>£6-7 million in additional costs</strong>.</p>\n\n      <h4>How Does This Compare?</h4>\n\n      <p>Regeneration projects of this scale in comparable towns provide useful benchmarks:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Burnley's Pioneer Place:</strong> A smaller-scale town centre regeneration costing approximately £20 million, with clearer scope definition and phasing</li>\n        <li><strong>Rochdale town centre:</strong> A £250 million regeneration programme, but for a council with a net budget roughly 10 times Hyndburn's</li>\n        <li><strong>Darwen town centre:</strong> Part of Blackburn with Darwen's regeneration, with total investment around £20-30 million for a comparable town</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>Hyndburn's programme is disproportionately large relative to its financial capacity. This is not necessarily wrong — ambition can drive transformation — but it means the margin for error is vanishingly thin. Any significant overspend, delay, or scope change has an outsized impact on a council of this size.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Parkinson Legacy: A Mega-Project Without Mega-Scrutiny</h4>\n\n      <p>The Accrington Town Square regeneration was conceived, initiated, and largely committed under the leadership of <strong>Cllr Miles Parkinson</strong> during his 12 years as council Leader (2011-2023). Parkinson championed the project as the centrepiece of Accrington's transformation, and it became closely identified with his personal political brand.</p>\n\n      <p>The problems with how this project was governed reflect Parkinson's broader leadership style:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Centralised decision-making:</strong> A project of this unprecedented scale should have been subject to the most rigorous scrutiny the council could muster. Instead, under Parkinson's model where he essentially decided most if not all major decisions, the scrutiny was inadequate for the risk involved</li>\n        <li><strong>The £10M discrepancy:</strong> The fact that the stated contract value varies by £10 million suggests either that Parkinson's administration did not communicate the total commitment clearly, or that the scope expanded without transparent public reporting. Either way, this reflects a governance failure at the top</li>\n        <li><strong>Timing with reserves collapse:</strong> The council committed to a £60-70 million capital programme during the same period when usable reserves were collapsing from £30 million to £12 million. A leader with proper regard for financial prudence would have questioned whether the council could afford this scale of commitment while its safety net was evaporating</li>\n        <li><strong>Successors bear the risk:</strong> By the time Parkinson lost his seat in May 2023, the project was already committed. Any cost overruns, delays, or variations will be paid for by the council and its taxpayers — but the decision to proceed was Parkinson's. The new leadership inherited a project they did not design, at a price they cannot easily renegotiate</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>Major regeneration projects can be transformative. But they require governance structures that match their scale and risk. Parkinson's centralised model was the opposite of what was needed.</p>\n\n      <h4>Morgan Sindall: The Contractor</h4>\n\n      <p>Morgan Sindall is a FTSE 250 construction and regeneration company. It is a substantial and experienced contractor with a strong track record nationally. The question for Hyndburn is not whether Morgan Sindall is a capable contractor — it is whether the council has the capacity to manage a contract of this size effectively.</p>\n\n      <p>Key considerations include:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Contract management resource:</strong> Does Hyndburn have sufficient in-house expertise to manage a £60-70 million contract? Small councils typically lack the specialist commercial and legal teams that major contracts require</li>\n        <li><strong>Variation control:</strong> How many contract variations have been approved, and what is their total value?</li>\n        <li><strong>Independent cost verification:</strong> Are project costs being independently verified, or is the council relying on the contractor's own reporting?</li>\n        <li><strong>Performance monitoring:</strong> What KPIs are in the contract, and are they being met?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>Questions the Council Must Answer</h4>\n\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>What is the EXACT total contract value</strong> with Morgan Sindall, including all variations and additional works approved to date?</li>\n        <li><strong>How many contract variations</strong> have been approved since the original award, and what is their total value?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the current projected completion date</strong> for all phases, compared to the original programme?</li>\n        <li><strong>What penalty clauses exist</strong> for late delivery, and have any been triggered?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the council's total financial exposure</strong> — including borrowing costs, staff time, consultancy fees, and any contributions from the council's own resources?</li>\n        <li><strong>Has an independent gateway review</strong> been conducted on the project? If so, what were the findings?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the projected economic impact</strong> of the completed development in terms of jobs, business rates income, and footfall?</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p>The people of Accrington deserve to know whether this investment in their town centre is on track, on budget, and delivering what was promised. The current information vacuum is not acceptable for a project of this scale.</p>\n\n      <p><em>Contract values are based on publicly reported figures from council documents and media sources.
