Residents deserve to understand how their money is being used and what safeguards are in place.</p>\n\n      <h4>What Is PEARL?</h4>\n\n      <p>PEARL is a joint venture company established to drive economic regeneration in Pendle. The model is straightforward in principle: the council contributes assets (typically land or buildings) and the private partner contributes capital and development expertise. Together, they deliver projects that neither could achieve alone.</p>\n\n      <p>But the devil is in the detail. Joint ventures create a <strong>separate legal entity</strong> that sits outside the council's normal governance structures. Decisions made by the joint venture board may not require full council approval. Financial commitments can be structured in ways that do not appear on the council's balance sheet. And the private partner's interests — maximising returns on investment — do not always align with the public interest.</p>\n\n      <h4>The National Track Record</h4>\n\n      <p>Council joint ventures have a mixed record nationally, with several high-profile failures that have cost taxpayers millions:</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Joint Venture</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Councils Involved</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Outcome</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Brick by Brick</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Croydon Council</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.15);\">Council went effectively bankrupt; company lost tens of millions; Section 114 notice issued</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Lendlease/HCA partnerships</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Various</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,149,0,0.15);\">Criticised for lack of affordable housing delivery and private partner extracting excessive returns</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Robin Hood Energy</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Nottingham City Council</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.15);\">Council-owned energy company lost £38 million before being sold; contributed to council's financial crisis</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Together Energy</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Warrington Borough Council</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.15);\">Council-backed energy company collapsed; £18 million lost</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>The common thread in these failures is <strong>insufficient governance, inadequate risk assessment, and a blurring of the line between public service and commercial speculation</strong>. Councils are not private developers, and councillors are not venture capitalists — yet joint ventures can create structures where public money is exposed to commercial risks without the commercial expertise to manage them.</p>\n\n      <h4>Key Governance Questions for PEARL</h4>\n\n      <p>None of the following questions imply wrongdoing. They are the basic transparency questions that any resident is entitled to ask about a joint venture spending public money:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Board composition</strong> — Who sits on the PEARL board? How many are council-appointed and how many represent the private partner? Do any board members have conflicts of interest?</li>\n        <li><strong>Decision-making authority</strong> — What decisions can the PEARL board make without returning to full council for approval? Are there financial thresholds above which council approval is required?</li>\n        <li><strong>Public investment</strong> — What is the total value of public assets (land, buildings, cash) committed to PEARL? What is the council's total financial exposure if the venture fails?</li>\n        <li><strong>Profit sharing</strong> — How are profits from PEARL developments shared between the council and the private partner? Is the split fair given the relative contributions?</li>\n        <li><strong>Risk allocation</strong> — If a development loses money, who bears the loss? Is the private partner truly sharing risk, or has the structure shifted most risk onto the public side?</li>\n        <li><strong>Exit provisions</strong> — What happens if the council wants to exit the joint venture? What are the financial penalties? Can the private partner force the council to sell assets?</li>\n        <li><strong>Performance monitoring</strong> — What metrics are used to evaluate PEARL's performance? Are these published? How does actual performance compare to the original business case?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>Transparency Is Not Opposition</h4>\n\n      <p>Asking these questions is not the same as opposing regeneration. Pendle needs investment and development. The question is whether a joint venture structure is the best way to achieve it, and whether the specific governance arrangements for PEARL adequately protect the public interest.</p>\n\n      <p>A well-governed joint venture with proper oversight, clear risk allocation, and genuine transparency can be a powerful tool for regeneration. A poorly governed one can become a mechanism for transferring public wealth to private hands while loading risk onto taxpayers.</p>\n\n      <h4>What Should Happen Next</h4>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Publish the shareholder agreement</strong> — The full agreement between the council and its private partner should be publicly available, with only genuinely commercially sensitive details redacted</li>\n        <li><strong>Annual public reporting</strong> — PEARL should publish an annual report including full financial accounts, project progress, and performance against the original business case</li>\n        <li><strong>Independent review</strong> — The council's external auditors should conduct an independent review of PEARL's governance arrangements and risk exposure</li>\n        <li><strong>Scrutiny committee oversight</strong> — The council's scrutiny committee should have a standing item on PEARL with the ability to call board members to give evidence</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p><em>This article raises questions about governance and transparency.
