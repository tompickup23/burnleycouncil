The cost of running Pendle's planning service — relative to the number of planning applications processed — is higher than any comparable district council in the North West region.</p>\n\n      <p>This matters for a simple reason: planning application fees (set nationally by government) should partially offset the cost of running the service. When costs are disproportionately high, the planning service becomes a significant <strong>net drain on the council's general fund</strong> — money that could otherwise be spent on other services.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Numbers</h4>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Council</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Est.

That is not a trivial sum — it is equivalent to roughly 5% of the council's entire spending power.</p>\n\n      <p>In a context where reserves are being depleted to cover a cumulative budget gap of £8.26 million, finding £600,000 in planning efficiency savings would make a meaningful contribution to closing that gap.</p>\n\n      <p>More broadly, an expensive planning service has knock-on effects. If applicants and developers perceive that Pendle is slow or costly compared to neighbouring authorities, they may choose to invest elsewhere — undermining the economic regeneration that the borough badly needs.</p>\n\n      <h4>CIPFA Benchmarking</h4>\n\n      <p>The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) publishes benchmarking data that allows councils to compare their costs on a like-for-like basis. The key metrics include:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Cost per planning application</strong> — Pendle's figure is estimated to be 50-80% above the peer group average</li>\n        <li><strong>Cost per head of population</strong> — How much each resident effectively pays for the planning service</li>\n        <li><strong>Income as a percentage of expenditure</strong> — What proportion of costs are recovered through fees — a lower percentage indicates a larger net burden on taxpayers</li>\n        <li><strong>Speed of decision-making</strong> — Whether the higher cost translates into faster decisions (if it does not, what is the additional spending achieving?)</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>Questions the Council Must Answer</h4>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>What is the planning department's total cost?</strong> — Including staffing, consultants, overheads, enforcement, appeals, and all support service recharges — what is the full cost of the planning function?</li>\n        <li><strong>How many FTE staff are employed?</strong> — What is the total full-time equivalent headcount in the planning department, and how does this compare to CIPFA nearest neighbours?</li>\n        <li><strong>What proportion of spending is on external consultants?</strong> — Are specialist functions being outsourced at premium rates when in-house provision might be more cost-effective?</li>\n        <li><strong>How does the cost per application compare to CIPFA benchmarks?</strong> — Has the council formally benchmarked its planning costs against statistical neighbours? If so, what did the comparison show?</li>\n        <li><strong>Has a service review been conducted?</strong> — Given the LGA's findings, has the council commissioned or undertaken a review of its planning service costs and efficiency?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the income recovery rate?</strong> — What percentage of planning costs are recovered through application fees and other income? How does this compare to the national average?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>A Question of Priorities</h4>\n\n      <p>Every pound spent on an inefficient planning service is a pound that cannot be spent on other priorities — homelessness prevention, environmental services, community safety, or maintaining the reserves that stand between the council and financial failure. Pendle cannot afford the luxury of being the most expensive planning authority in the North West.</p>\n\n      <p><em>Cost estimates in this article are based on published council budget documents, LGA peer review findings, CIPFA benchmarking data, and published planning application statistics. Actual figures may differ depending on accounting methodology and cost categorisation. This article does not allege inefficiency — it identifies questions that the data raises.</em></p>\n    "
