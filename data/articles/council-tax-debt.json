Collection processes, enforcement activity, and the performance of the outsourced revenues service all play a role — and all deserve scrutiny.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Scale of the Problem</h4>\n\n      <p>Approximately <strong>£13 million</strong> in council tax remains uncollected across multiple financial years. To put this in perspective:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>Burnley's net revenue budget is approximately <strong>£15 million per year</strong></li>\n        <li>The uncollected debt therefore represents roughly <strong>87% of one year's entire budget</strong></li>\n        <li>Even if only 50% of this debt were recoverable, it would represent <strong>£6.5 million</strong> — more than enough to close the council's projected funding gap</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>Collection Rates Over Time</h4>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Year</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Council Tax Set</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Amount Collected (est.)</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">In-Year Collection Rate</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Arrears Added (est.)</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2020/21</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£45M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£42.3M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~94.0%</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£2.7M</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2021/22</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£46M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£43.7M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~95.0%</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£2.3M</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2022/23</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£48M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£45.6M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~95.0%</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£2.4M</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2023/24</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£50M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£47.5M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~95.0%</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£2.5M</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2024/25</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£52M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£49.4M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~95.0%</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£2.6M</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p><em>Note: These are estimated figures based on available data.

Even a modest improvement in collection rates could generate significant additional income without raising council tax.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Deprivation Factor</h4>\n\n      <p>Burnley is one of the <strong>most deprived boroughs in England</strong>, ranking in the bottom 10% nationally on the Index of Multiple Deprivation. This context is important:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>Many residents genuinely <strong>cannot afford to pay</strong> — they are choosing between council tax and heating or food</li>\n        <li>A high proportion of residents receive <strong>Council Tax Support</strong> (the replacement for Council Tax Benefit), which reduces the collectible amount</li>\n        <li>High levels of <strong>household transience</strong> — people moving frequently — make collection more difficult</li>\n        <li>A large proportion of <strong>Band A properties</strong> means lower average bills but also lower income per household for the council</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>Deprivation is a genuine mitigating factor. But it does not explain the full £13 million. Other deprived boroughs achieve better collection rates, and the growing debt mountain suggests that <strong>collection processes themselves may not be effective enough</strong>.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Liberata Factor</h4>\n\n      <p>Until 2026, revenues and benefits services — including council tax collection — have been outsourced to <strong>Liberata UK Ltd</strong> under a contract worth over £21 million across its lifetime.</p>\n\n      <p>Key questions about Liberata's collection performance:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>What are the contractual collection rate targets? Is Liberata meeting them?</li>\n        <li>What incentives exist for Liberata to pursue older, harder-to-collect debt?</li>\n        <li>Is Liberata's performance better or worse than an in-house collection team would achieve?</li>\n        <li>As the contract ends in 2026, will the transition back to in-house services affect collection activity?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>The Cost of Collection</h4>\n\n      <p>There is a point at which chasing old debt costs more than it recovers. The council must balance:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Cost of enforcement:</strong> Court costs, bailiff fees, officer time, legal expenses</li>\n        <li><strong>Recovery rate:</strong> What percentage of enforced debt is actually collected?</li>\n        <li><strong>Social impact:</strong> Aggressive enforcement in deprived areas can cause genuine hardship</li>\n        <li><strong>Write-off policy:</strong> At what point is debt deemed uncollectable and written off?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>A rational approach would segment the £13 million debt by age and collectability, focusing enforcement resources where recovery is most likely and writing off genuinely uncollectable debt to avoid wasting further money pursuing it.</p>\n\n      <h4>Questions That Need Answering</h4>\n\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>What is the age profile of the £13M debt?</strong> How much is less than 1 year old, 1-3 years, 3-5 years, and over 5 years?</li>\n        <li><strong>How much is deemed uncollectable?</strong> What proportion of the debt has been assessed as having no realistic prospect of recovery?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the annual cost of collection activity?</strong> How much does it cost to pursue outstanding debt, and what is the return on that investment?</li>\n        <li><strong>What write-off policy is in place?</strong> When and how are debts formally written off?</li>\n        <li><strong>What are Liberata's contractual KPIs for collection?</strong> Are they meeting targets?</li>\n        <li><strong>What happens to outstanding debt when services return in-house?</strong> Will the transition disrupt collection activity?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the council's approach to vulnerable debtors?</strong> Are hardship policies in place for residents who genuinely cannot pay?</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p><em>This article is based on publicly available information including council financial statements, DLUHC council tax collection statistics, and published performance data.
