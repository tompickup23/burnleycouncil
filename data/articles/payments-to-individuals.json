  "content": "\n      <p><strong>Burnley Borough Council has made £4,713,891 in payments directly to individuals and sole traders</strong> across 1,247 transactions. While many will be legitimate, this pattern warrants scrutiny.</p>\n\n      <h4>Types of Individual Payments</h4>\n\n      <p>Payments to individuals typically include:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Self-employed contractors and consultants</li>\n        <li>Freelance professionals (photographers, designers, etc.)</li>\n        <li>Temporary specialist staff</li>\n        <li>Expert witnesses and advisors</li>\n        <li>Training providers and facilitators</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>Key Concerns</h4>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>IR35 Compliance:</strong> Are these genuinely self-employed workers or disguised employees?</li>\n        <li><strong>Tax Status:</strong> Is HMRC receiving correct tax payments?</li>\n        <li><strong>Employment Rights:</strong> Are workers being denied employment protections?</li>\n        <li><strong>Procurement Rules:</strong> Are competitive processes being followed?</li>\n        <li><strong>Value for Money:</strong> How do individual rates compare to agency or employee costs?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>The IR35 Risk</h4>\n\n      <p>Public sector bodies have been required since 2017 to assess the tax status of contractors. Getting this wrong can result in:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Back-tax liabilities for the council</li>\n        <li>National Insurance contributions owed</li>\n        <li>Penalties from HMRC</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>With £4.7 million in individual payments, ensuring proper compliance is essential.</p>\n\n      <p><em>All figures are derived from publicly available council spending data.</em></p>\n    "
