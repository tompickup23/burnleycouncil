For a district council with a net budget of around £15 million, the question is no longer whether this was a good deal — it is whether the council can afford to keep holding it.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Acquisition</h4>\n\n      <p>Burnley Council purchased Charter Walk shopping centre as a commercial investment, intended to generate rental income that would support the council's revenue budget. At the time of acquisition, the logic was straightforward: buy a retail asset, collect rents, use the income to fund services.</p>\n\n      <p>The purchase price was <strong>£20.7 million</strong> — a figure that exceeded the council's entire annual net revenue budget. This was funded through borrowing, adding significantly to the council's debt obligations.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Income Collapse</h4>\n\n      <p>Since acquisition, the performance of Charter Walk has deteriorated substantially. Rental income has reportedly fallen by approximately <strong>58%</strong>, reflecting the wider crisis in high street retail that has accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Metric</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">At Acquisition (Est.)</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Current (Est.)</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Change</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Acquisition Cost</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">£20.7M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">—</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">—</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Annual Gross Rental Income</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£1.8M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£0.76M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem; color:#ef4444;\">-58%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Annual Management & Maintenance Costs</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Unknown</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Unknown</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">—</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Net Return After Costs</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Unknown</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Unknown</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">—</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Estimated Current Valuation</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">£20.7M (paid)</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Not disclosed</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem; color:#ef4444;\">Significant loss likely</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Gross Yield (Rent / Purchase Price)</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~8.7%</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~3.7%</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem; color:#ef4444;\">-5.0 points</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>A gross yield of approximately 3.7% — before management costs, maintenance, void periods, and debt servicing — is marginal at best. Once all costs are factored in, it is entirely possible that Charter Walk is generating a <strong>net loss</strong> for the council.</p>\n\n      <h4>Seeking External Asset Managers</h4>\n\n      <p>The council is now seeking external asset managers to take over the running of Charter Walk. This is a significant admission: <strong>the council is acknowledging that it does not have the internal expertise to manage a major commercial property asset.</strong></p>\n\n      <p>This raises several questions:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>If the council lacked property management expertise, why did it acquire a £20.7M shopping centre?</li>\n        <li>What will external asset management cost, and will this further erode the already-reduced income?</li>\n        <li>What performance targets and KPIs will be set for the external managers?</li>\n        <li>Is the appointment of asset managers a precursor to eventual disposal?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>The Debt Ratio Problem</h4>\n\n      <p>Burnley's council debt ratio stands at approximately <strong>25% of annual revenue</strong>. For a district council with a net budget of around £15 million, this is in the danger zone. The debt is not solely attributable to Charter Walk — the council has other borrowing commitments — but the shopping centre acquisition is a major component.</p>\n\n      <p>To put this in perspective:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>The annual debt servicing costs (interest + minimum revenue provision) consume a significant portion of the council's budget</li>\n        <li>Every pound spent on debt repayment is a pound not available for services</li>\n        <li>If Charter Walk's net income does not cover its share of debt costs, the council is effectively subsidising a loss-making commercial property from council tax</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>The Pioneer Place Connection</h4>\n\n      <p>Charter Walk is not the council's only major commercial property exposure. The <strong>Pioneer Place development</strong> — for which Geldards solicitors received a £20.1 million pass-through payment — represents another significant bet on Burnley town centre.</p>\n\n      <p>Combined, these two investments give the council <strong>over £40 million of exposure to Burnley's commercial property market</strong>. For a district council of Burnley's size, this concentration of risk in a single asset class in a single town is exceptional.</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Commercial Property Asset</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Investment</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Status</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Charter Walk Shopping Centre</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">£20.7M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Rental income down ~58%</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Pioneer Place (via Geldards)</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">£20.1M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Ongoing</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Total Commercial Property Exposure</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£40.8M</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~2.7x annual budget</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <h4>The Timing Question</h4>\n\n      <p>In fairness, the acquisition was made before the accelerated decline of high street retail. Many councils across England made similar investments during the same period, and most have suffered similar losses. Burnley is not unique in this regard.</p>\n\n      <p>However, the question is no longer about the original decision. It is about <strong>what the council does now</strong>. Continuing to hold a depreciating asset while paying debt servicing costs and now adding external management fees raises the question of whether the council is throwing good money after bad.</p>\n\n      <h4>Questions That Need Answering</h4>\n\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>What is the current independent valuation of Charter Walk?</strong> If the asset has depreciated significantly from the £20.7M purchase price, this should be disclosed.</li>\n        <li><strong>What are the total annual management and maintenance costs?</strong> Without this figure, it is impossible to calculate the true net return.</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the annual debt servicing cost attributable to the Charter Walk acquisition?</strong></li>\n        <li><strong>What exit options have been considered?</strong> Has the council explored disposal, partial disposal, or conversion to alternative uses?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the break-even rental occupancy level?</strong> At what point does the income cover all associated costs?</li>\n        <li><strong>What are the terms of the proposed external asset management arrangement?</strong> Fixed fee, percentage of income, or performance-based?</li>\n        <li><strong>Given LGR, who inherits this asset and its associated debt?</strong> Will a successor unitary authority be burdened with Burnley's commercial property liabilities?</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p><em>This article is based on publicly available information including council financial statements, audit reports, and published spending data.
