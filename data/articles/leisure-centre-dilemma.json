Unlike some leisure trusts that aim to break even or generate a surplus, Pendle's arrangement requires an ongoing annual subsidy from the council's general fund.</p>\n\n      <p>At approximately <strong>£1.9 million per year</strong>, the leisure subsidy represents roughly <strong>15% of Pendle's entire net revenue budget</strong> of £12-13 million. This makes it one of the council's single largest discretionary spending commitments.</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Year</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Estimated Leisure Subsidy</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Net Revenue Budget</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Subsidy as % of Budget</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Estimated Remaining Reserves</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2023/24</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~£1.8M</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~£12.5M</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~14%</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~£6.5M</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2024/25</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~£1.9M</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~£12.8M</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~15%</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~£4.3M</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color); background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>2025/26</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£1.9M</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£13.0M</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~15%</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.3);\"><strong>~£1.5M</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color); background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>2026/27</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£1.9M</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£13.0M</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~15%</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.3);\"><strong>~£0 (exhausted)</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>The critical point is this: in a year when reserves could be exhausted, the council will still be contractually obligated to pay nearly <strong>£2 million</strong> for leisure services. There is no flexibility to reduce this commitment — the contract runs to 2033.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Extension Decision</h4>\n\n      <p>Extending the leisure contract to 2033 was not an inevitable decision. Contracts come up for renewal, and that moment provides the opportunity to renegotiate terms, explore alternative delivery models, or fundamentally reconsider the service.</p>\n\n      <p>For a council that Grant Thornton has identified as having \"significant weaknesses\" in financial sustainability, choosing to <strong>lock in a £1.9M annual commitment for another decade</strong> raises serious questions about priorities and financial planning. The total committed subsidy from now to 2033 is estimated at:</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Period</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Years</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Estimated Annual Subsidy</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Estimated Total Committed</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color); background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>2025 to 2033</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~8 years</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£1.9M-£2.4M (with inflation)</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£15M-£19M</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>That is £15-19 million that future councils and future taxpayers are now committed to spending, regardless of what other financial pressures emerge. For context, that sum exceeds Pendle's entire annual net revenue budget.</p>\n\n      <h4>How Does Pendle Compare?</h4>\n\n      <p>Leisure provision is a challenge for all district councils. None of the East Lancashire councils operates leisure services at a profit. But the approach varies:</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Council</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Delivery Model</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Estimated Annual Subsidy</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Population</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Subsidy Per Resident</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Pendle</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">External leisure contract (extended to 2033)</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.15);\"><strong>~£1.9M</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~92,000</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.15);\"><strong>~£20.65</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Hyndburn</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Leisure trust (Hyndburn Leisure)</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,149,0,0.15);\">~£1.2M</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~81,000</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,149,0,0.15);\">~£14.81</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Burnley</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">External trust/operator</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~£1.0M</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~88,000</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~£11.36</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>Pendle's subsidy per resident is nearly <strong>double</strong> that of Burnley and approximately <strong>40% higher</strong> than Hyndburn. While differences in facility age, size, and usage will account for some of this variation, the gap is significant — particularly for a council facing the most severe financial pressures of the three.</p>\n\n      <h4>Alternative Models</h4>\n\n      <p>Other councils facing similar challenges have explored alternative approaches:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Community asset transfer</strong> — transferring individual facilities to community groups or sports clubs who can access funding unavailable to commercial operators</li>\n        <li><strong>Targeted subsidy reduction</strong> — renegotiating contracts with annual subsidy reduction targets, incentivising the operator to grow income</li>\n        <li><strong>Facility rationalisation</strong> — closing or repurposing the least financially viable facilities to concentrate resources on those that deliver the most benefit per pound</li>\n        <li><strong>In-house operation</strong> — some councils have found that bringing services back in-house (removing the operator's profit margin and overheads) can reduce net costs</li>\n        <li><strong>Joint commissioning</strong> — partnering with neighbouring councils to commission leisure services at scale, reducing per-unit management costs</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>Questions the Council Must Answer</h4>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>What was the business case for extending to 2033?</strong> — Was a full options appraisal conducted? Were alternative delivery models considered and costed? Was the financial sustainability context factored into the decision?</li>\n        <li><strong>What break clauses exist?</strong> — Can the council exit the contract early if its financial position deteriorates further? What are the penalties for early termination?</li>\n        <li><strong>What performance standards are contractually required?</strong> — Is the operator required to achieve participation targets, income targets, or subsidy reduction targets? What happens if these are not met?</li>\n        <li><strong>Is the subsidy indexed to inflation?</strong> — Will the annual subsidy increase with inflation, potentially pushing the total commitment above £19 million?</li>\n        <li><strong>What was the scrutiny process?</strong> — Did the extension go through the council's scrutiny committee? Was there a public consultation?</li>\n        <li><strong>What are the usage figures?</strong> — How many residents actually use the leisure centres? What is the effective subsidy per visit?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>The Fundamental Tension</h4>\n\n      <p>Nobody disputes the importance of leisure facilities for public health, community wellbeing, and quality of life. The question is not whether leisure matters — it does — but whether a council facing potential reserves exhaustion within two years can afford to lock in a £1.9M annual commitment for a further decade without exploring every possible alternative.</p>\n\n      <p>If Pendle issues a Section 114 notice, leisure centres will be among the first services affected. Committing to the 2033 extension may, paradoxically, make it harder to protect those very services when the financial reckoning arrives.</p>\n\n      <p><em>Subsidy figures are estimates based on published council budget documents, committee reports, and publicly available financial data.
