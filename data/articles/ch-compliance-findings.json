While this is the cleanest record of the three East Lancashire councils, the nature of the breaches is still concerning.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Four Suppliers</h4>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Supplier</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Paid During Breach</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Issue</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td><strong>Marston (Holdings) Ltd</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>£17,100</strong></td><td>Filed dormant accounts but receiving payments</td></tr>\n        <tr><td><strong>Jewson Ltd</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>£17,000</strong></td><td>Filed dormant accounts but receiving payments</td></tr>\n        <tr><td><strong>Auto Match Ltd</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>£3,400</strong></td><td>Confirmation statement overdue; filed dormant but receiving payments</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Fourth supplier</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£300</td><td>Companies House breach</td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <h4>The \"Dormant But Active\" Problem</h4>\n\n      <p>The most common pattern among Pendle's non-compliant suppliers is companies that have <strong>filed dormant accounts at Companies House while still receiving council payments</strong>. This is a significant red flag.</p>\n\n      <p>A dormant company is one that has had no \"significant accounting transactions\" during the financial year. If a company is receiving thousands of pounds from a council, it is by definition not dormant. Filing dormant accounts while trading is potentially:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>A breach of the Companies Act</strong> — dormant accounts are a simplified filing option only available to genuinely inactive companies</li>\n        <li><strong>Tax avoidance</strong> — dormant companies have different tax obligations, so filing dormant accounts while trading could reduce tax liability</li>\n        <li><strong>A sign of poor governance</strong> — the company may not have adequate financial controls</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>Marston (Holdings) Ltd: £17,100</h4>\n\n      <p>Marston (Holdings) Ltd is the enforcement arm used by many councils for council tax and parking fine collection. The company filed dormant accounts while receiving payments from Pendle — suggesting either a corporate restructuring issue or a filing error. Either way, a council should verify the status of companies it contracts with for enforcement services.</p>\n\n      <h4>Jewson Ltd: £17,000</h4>\n\n      <p>Jewson is a well-known building materials supplier. Again, dormant accounts were filed while the company received payments. Given Jewson is part of the Saint-Gobain group, this may reflect a holding company structure issue — but the council should still verify which entity it is actually contracting with.</p>\n\n      <h4>How Pendle Compares</h4>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Council</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">CH Breach Payments</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Suppliers Affected</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td>Hyndburn</td><td style=\"text-align:right; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">£1,100,000</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">17</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Burnley</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£223,900</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">—</td></tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(52,199,89,0.2);\"><td><strong>Pendle</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>£37,800</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>4</strong></td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>At £37,800, Pendle's exposure is a fraction of Hyndburn's £1.1 million. This suggests either better supplier vetting practices or simply a different supplier mix. Either way, the council deserves credit for having the cleanest compliance record — while still needing to address the four cases identified.</p>\n\n      <p><em>Companies House data accessed via the official API.
