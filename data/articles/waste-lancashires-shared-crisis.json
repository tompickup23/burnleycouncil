Central government's food waste collection mandate requires entirely new infrastructure. And Lancashire County Council, as the waste disposal authority, is restructuring arrangements across the region. The combined cost impact could exceed £8-10 million per year — and every council is scrambling.</strong></p>\n\n      <h4>The Perfect Storm: Three Crises at Once</h4>\n\n      <p>East Lancashire's waste situation is not a single problem but three converging crises:</p>\n\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>Whinney Hill landfill closure:</strong> The primary disposal route for the region's residual waste has closed, forcing all three councils to find alternative arrangements at higher cost</li>\n        <li><strong>Food waste collection mandate:</strong> Central government requires all councils to implement separate food waste collections — new bins, new vehicles, new collection rounds, new processing capacity</li>\n        <li><strong>LCC disposal restructuring:</strong> Lancashire County Council, as the statutory Waste Disposal Authority under Section 30 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, is restructuring disposal arrangements across the county</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p>Each of these alone would strain council budgets. Together, they represent a generational challenge for waste management in East Lancashire.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Cost Impact: Council by Council</h4>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Council</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Current Waste Cost</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Est.

For Pendle, the estimated £2.6 million in additional waste costs represents roughly <strong>19% of the council's net revenue budget</strong>. That is nearly a fifth of all discretionary spending consumed by a single service area increase.</p>\n\n      <h4>Whinney Hill: The End of an Era</h4>\n\n      <p>Whinney Hill landfill near Altham had been the primary disposal site for East Lancashire's residual waste since the 1970s, operated by SUEZ. Its closure was signalled clearly in late 2023, giving councils over two years to prepare. Despite this warning:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>None of the four East Lancashire councils</strong> (Burnley, Pendle, Hyndburn, Rossendale) delivered an operational waste transfer station by the closure date</li>\n        <li>A joint feasibility study between councils collapsed when the proposed site proved unviable</li>\n        <li>Burnley eventually identified its Heasandford depot as a potential site — but this required purchasing adjacent land and converting the facility</li>\n        <li>Hyndburn has reportedly <strong>not secured a waste transfer station at all</strong>, leaving it most exposed to increased transport costs</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>Without local transfer stations, waste must travel much further for disposal — dramatically increasing transport costs, vehicle wear, fuel consumption, and carbon emissions. The council that fails to secure a local transfer station pays the highest ongoing transport costs indefinitely.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Burnley Approach: FCC Contract Renewed</h4>\n\n      <p>Burnley awarded a new 8-year Waste and Cleansing Services contract to FCC Environment commencing April 2026, valued at approximately <strong>£4.7 million per year running to 2034</strong>. This followed a transition from the previous Urbaser contract:</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Year</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Supplier</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Amount</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2021/22</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Urbaser Ltd</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">£5,182,177</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2022/23</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Urbaser Ltd</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">£5,796,560</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2023/24</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Urbaser Ltd</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">£4,954,248</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2024/25</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Urbaser Ltd + FCC</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">£6,529,864</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2026 onwards</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">FCC Environment</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£4.7M/yr (est.)</td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>Notably, the FCC contract was renewed <strong>without a competitive tender process</strong>. While there may be legitimate reasons for this (procurement timelines, market conditions, service continuity), it raises questions about whether the council secured the best possible price.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Food Waste Mandate: New Bins, New Trucks, New Costs</h4>\n\n      <p>Central government's requirement for separate food waste collections represents an entirely new service that councils must fund and deliver. The requirements include:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>New bins:</strong> Every household needs a dedicated food waste caddy and kerbside collection bin</li>\n        <li><strong>New vehicles:</strong> Specialised food waste collection vehicles must be purchased or leased — standard refuse trucks cannot be used</li>\n        <li><strong>New collection rounds:</strong> Food waste must be collected weekly (more frequently than general waste), requiring additional crews and routes</li>\n        <li><strong>New processing capacity:</strong> Collected food waste requires anaerobic digestion or in-vessel composting facilities — Lancashire currently lacks sufficient capacity</li>\n        <li><strong>Ongoing revenue costs:</strong> This is not a one-off capital investment but a permanent addition to annual collection costs</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>Timeline: Key Dates</h4>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Date</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Event</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Impact</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Late 2023</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">SUEZ signals Whinney Hill closure timeline</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Two-year warning for councils to prepare</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Throughout 2024</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Councils fail to identify waste transfer station sites</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Joint feasibility study collapses</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">April 2026</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Whinney Hill closes; Envirofuel interim contract begins</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">70,000-80,000 tonnes/year diverted to Envirofuel in Burnley</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">April 2026</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Burnley's new FCC waste collection contract begins</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">8-year commitment at ~£4.7M/year</td></tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\"><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>2026/27</strong></td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Food waste collection mandate takes effect</strong></td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>All councils must implement new collections</strong></td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2027-2028</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">LGR transition period begins</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Waste arrangements may need renegotiation under new unitary authorities</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2028 (approx)</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Envirofuel interim contract ends</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Long-term disposal solution must be in place</td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <h4>Combined Impact: £8-10M+ Per Year Across East Lancashire</h4>\n\n      <p>When you add the additional costs across all three East Lancashire district councils, the combined annual impact is staggering:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Burnley:</strong> ~£1.5-2M additional annual costs (transfer station operation, food waste collection, increased disposal gate fees)</li>\n        <li><strong>Hyndburn:</strong> ~£2-3M additional annual costs (no transfer station means highest transport costs, plus food waste infrastructure from scratch)</li>\n        <li><strong>Pendle:</strong> ~£2.6M additional annual costs (food waste mandate, increased disposal costs, potential transfer station costs)</li>\n        <li><strong>Combined:</strong> Potentially <strong>£8-10 million or more per year</strong> in additional waste costs across the three boroughs</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>To put this in context: £8-10 million per year is more than many district councils' entire discretionary budgets. It is equivalent to roughly 500-600 full-time council employees at average local government salaries. Something else will have to give — whether that is other services, council tax levels, or reserve drawdowns.</p>\n\n      <h4>The LGR Complication</h4>\n\n      <p>The waste crisis and Local Government Reorganisation are on a collision course. If councils merge into new unitary authorities during 2027-2028:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Existing waste contracts transfer</strong> to the successor authority — including Burnley's 8-year FCC contract</li>\n        <li><strong>Contradictory arrangements:</strong> One district's waste may be going to Envirofuel while another's goes to Farington — under the same new authority</li>\n        <li><strong>Renegotiation opportunity:</strong> LGR could provide an opportunity to negotiate better terms by combining the waste collection needs of multiple former districts into a single larger contract</li>\n        <li><strong>Renegotiation risk:</strong> Alternatively, contractors may use the disruption of LGR to push for higher prices, knowing the new authority has limited capacity to manage a procurement exercise during its formation period</li>\n        <li><strong>Responsibility gaps:</strong> During the transition, it may be unclear which body — the old district, the shadow authority, or the new unitary — is responsible for waste infrastructure decisions</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>The County Council's Role</h4>\n\n      <p>Lancashire County Council, as the Waste Disposal Authority, has the statutory duty under Section 51 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to arrange for the disposal of waste collected by the four East Lancashire borough councils. Key questions about the county's plans include:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>What is the <strong>long-term disposal strategy</strong> once the Envirofuel interim contract ends?</li>\n        <li>What <strong>capital investment</strong> is the county council making in new disposal infrastructure?</li>\n        <li>How will <strong>gate fees</strong> change under new disposal arrangements, and how will these costs be allocated to each collection authority?</li>\n        <li>What is the county council's plan for <strong>food waste processing capacity</strong> — does Lancashire have sufficient anaerobic digestion facilities?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>Questions for All Three Councils</h4>\n\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>What is the county council's disposal plan</strong> for East Lancashire beyond the Envirofuel interim contract?</li>\n        <li><strong>What are the exact cost projections</strong> per district for the combined impact of Whinney Hill closure, food waste mandate, and new disposal arrangements?</li>\n        <li><strong>What funding is available from central government</strong> to support food waste collection implementation? Has each council applied for all available grants?</li>\n        <li><strong>Has Hyndburn secured a waste transfer station?</strong> If not, what is the additional annual transport cost compared to councils that have?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the plan for waste arrangements under LGR?</strong> Has any financial modelling been done on combining waste contracts across merged authorities?</li>\n        <li><strong>What are the exact food waste implementation timelines</strong> for each council? What is the capital cost and what is the ongoing revenue cost?</li>\n        <li><strong>How will increased waste costs be funded?</strong> Through council tax increases, service cuts, reserve drawdowns, or a combination?</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p>Waste collection is the most visible service any district council provides. Every household interacts with it every week. When it goes wrong — missed collections, increased costs, reduced service — residents notice immediately. The waste crisis is not a distant financial abstraction. It is coming to every doorstep in East Lancashire, and residents deserve honest answers about what it will cost.</p>\n\n      <p><em>Cost estimates are based on publicly available council budget documents, committee papers, and published spending data. The £2.6M Pendle additional cost estimate is sourced from council reports. Burnley's FCC contract values are from published transparency data. Hyndburn's transfer station status is based on available public information. Exact costs will depend on final disposal arrangements, gate fees, and central government funding decisions.
