That is the total amount the council has available, after government grants and council tax income, to fund all discretionary services — parks, planning, street cleaning, environmental health, leisure, economic development, and more.</p>\n\n      <p>Against this relatively small budget, the cumulative shortfall identified in the medium-term financial strategy is <strong>£8.26 million by 2025/26</strong>. To put that in perspective: the gap represents over <strong>60% of the council's entire annual spending power</strong>. This is not a marginal shortfall that can be closed by trimming a few budgets. It is a structural deficit that threatens the council's ability to deliver basic services.</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Financial Year</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Annual Budget Gap (Est.)</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Reserves Used to Balance</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Estimated Remaining Usable Reserves</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2023/24</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~£1.5M</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~£1.5M</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~£6.5M</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2024/25</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~£2.2M</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~£2.2M</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~£4.3M</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color); background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>2025/26</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£2.8M</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£2.8M</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£1.5M</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color); background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>2026/27</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£1.8M (projected)</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£1.5M (all remaining)</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.3);\"><strong>~£0 — EXHAUSTED</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color); background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>2027/28</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£1.8M+ (projected)</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>None available</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.3);\"><strong>NEGATIVE — s114 territory</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p><em>Figures are estimates based on published medium-term financial strategy documents and Grant Thornton's auditor commentary. Actual figures may vary depending on savings achieved, government funding settlements, and in-year budget performance.</em></p>\n\n      <h4>Reserves: A One-Time Cushion, Not a Strategy</h4>\n\n      <p>Reserves exist to manage unexpected costs and smooth the impact of funding changes. They are a <strong>finite resource</strong> — once spent, they are gone. Using reserves to balance the annual budget is the local government equivalent of paying your mortgage by selling the furniture. It works for a while, but you eventually run out of furniture.</p>\n\n      <p>Grant Thornton explicitly highlighted this practice as a concern, noting that the council's approach to financial sustainability relies on reserve drawdowns that cannot continue indefinitely. The auditor's finding of \"significant weaknesses\" is a formal assessment — it means the council has failed to demonstrate that its financial plans are sustainable over the medium term.</p>\n\n      <h4>What Happens When Reserves Run Out? The Section 114 Question</h4>\n\n      <p>Under the Local Government Finance Act 1988, a council's chief finance officer (the Section 151 officer) must issue a <strong>Section 114 notice</strong> if they believe the council is unable to set a balanced budget. This is effectively a declaration of financial failure — the local government equivalent of bankruptcy.</p>\n\n      <p>When a Section 114 notice is issued:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>All non-essential spending stops immediately</strong> — only statutory services and contractual obligations continue</li>\n        <li><strong>Full council must meet within 21 days</strong> to consider the notice and decide on a course of action</li>\n        <li><strong>The government typically intervenes</strong> — DLUHC (Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities) may appoint commissioners to run the council</li>\n        <li><strong>Council tax may increase substantially</strong> — commissioners often impose significant council tax rises to restore financial balance</li>\n        <li><strong>Services are cut to the bone</strong> — discretionary services like leisure, parks, street cleaning, and economic development face severe reductions or elimination</li>\n        <li><strong>Staff redundancies follow</strong> — the council's workforce is typically reduced significantly</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>Recent examples include <strong>Croydon, Slough, Thurrock, Woking, and Birmingham</strong> — all of which issued Section 114 notices and saw dramatic service cuts, staff losses, and government intervention.</p>\n\n      <h4>How Does Pendle Compare to Its Neighbours?</h4>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Indicator</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Pendle</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Burnley</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Hyndburn</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Auditor Assessment</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.15);\"><strong>Significant weaknesses</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">National backlog — not yet assessed</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,149,0,0.15);\">Disclaimer of opinion (2 years)</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Budget Gap (cumulative)</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.15);\"><strong>~£8.26M by 2025/26</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Significant but managed</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,149,0,0.15);\">Significant</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Reserves Trajectory</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.15);\"><strong>Declining — exhaustion by ~2027/28</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Under pressure but maintained</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,149,0,0.15);\">Under pressure</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">s114 Risk</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.15);\"><strong>Elevated</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Low-moderate</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; background: rgba(255,149,0,0.15);\">Moderate</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>Pendle's position is the most concerning of the three East Lancashire councils. While all three face financial pressures — driven by 14 years of reduced central government funding, rising demand, and inflation — Pendle's combination of a large structural deficit, declining reserves, and an auditor finding of significant weaknesses puts it in a distinct category of risk.</p>\n\n      <h4>Questions the Council Must Answer</h4>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>What is the current reserves position?</strong> — What is the exact level of usable reserves as of the latest monitoring report? How does this compare to the projection in the medium-term financial strategy?</li>\n        <li><strong>What savings have been identified to close the gap?</strong> — The medium-term financial strategy should identify specific savings proposals. How much of the £8.26M gap is covered by identified, deliverable savings versus unidentified or aspirational targets?</li>\n        <li><strong>Has the Section 151 officer considered issuing a Section 114 notice?</strong> — This is a legitimate question that any councillor or resident is entitled to ask. If the answer is no, what gives the s151 officer confidence that the budget can be balanced without one?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the minimum safe level of reserves?</strong> — What does the council consider the minimum level of reserves needed to manage financial risks? When will reserves fall below this threshold?</li>\n        <li><strong>What contingency plans exist?</strong> — If savings targets are not met, or if new cost pressures emerge (such as waste disposal — see our separate article), what is the fallback position?</li>\n        <li><strong>Has DLUHC been engaged?</strong> — Given the auditor's findings, has the council engaged with the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities about its financial position?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>What This Means for Residents</h4>\n\n      <p>If Pendle's financial trajectory is not corrected, the consequences for residents will be severe. Essential services will be cut. Council tax will likely rise. Staff will be made redundant. The council's ability to invest in the borough's future — economic development, housing, town centre improvements — will be virtually eliminated.</p>\n\n      <p>The time for difficult decisions is now, not when reserves have already run out and the only option left is a Section 114 notice and government commissioners.</p>\n\n      <p><em>Financial projections in this article are estimates based on published council documents, Grant Thornton auditor reports, and publicly available medium-term financial strategy data.
