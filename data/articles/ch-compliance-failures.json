A company with no active directors cannot legally operate, make decisions, or enter into contracts. Yet Hyndburn continued paying them with public money.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Worst Cases</h4>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Supplier</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Paid During Breach</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Issue</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\"><td><strong>B3P Services Ltd</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>£420,200</strong></td><td>No active directors</td></tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\"><td><strong>JDS Trucks Ltd</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>£287,300</strong></td><td>No active directors AND no PSC</td></tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\"><td><strong>Homewise Society Ltd</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>£158,600</strong></td><td>No active directors AND no PSC</td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <h4>What Does \"No Active Directors\" Actually Mean?</h4>\n\n      <p>When a company has no active directors registered at Companies House, it means:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>No one can legally sign contracts</strong> — any agreement the council entered into may be unenforceable</li>\n        <li><strong>No one is legally responsible</strong> — if something goes wrong, there is no director to hold accountable</li>\n        <li><strong>The company may be fraudulent</strong> — shell companies and dormant entities sometimes have no directors</li>\n        <li><strong>Annual accounts may not be filed</strong> — meaning the company's financial health is unknown</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>B3P Services Ltd: £420,200 — The Biggest Concern</h4>\n\n      <p>B3P Services Ltd received over £420,000 from Hyndburn while having <strong>no active directors</strong> registered at Companies House. This is the single largest payment to a non-compliant supplier across all three East Lancashire councils we analysed. Who authorised these contracts? Who verified the company was capable of delivering?</p>\n\n      <h4>JDS Trucks Ltd: £287,300 — No Directors AND No PSC</h4>\n\n      <p>JDS Trucks Ltd had <strong>neither active directors nor a person with significant control (PSC)</strong> registered. The PSC register was introduced to prevent money laundering and tax evasion. A company with no PSC is essentially invisible to regulatory oversight — yet it received nearly £290,000 of public money.</p>\n\n      <h4>How This Compares</h4>\n\n      <p>Across the three East Lancashire councils:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Hyndburn:</strong> £1.1 million to 17 suppliers — worst compliance record</li>\n        <li><strong>Burnley:</strong> £223,900 to breaching suppliers</li>\n        <li><strong>Pendle:</strong> £37,800 to 4 suppliers — best compliance record</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>Hyndburn's exposure is nearly <strong>five times</strong> that of Burnley and <strong>29 times</strong> that of Pendle. This is not a rounding error — it suggests a systemic failure in supplier due diligence.</p>\n\n      <h4>What Should Happen</h4>\n\n      <p>The council should immediately:</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Review all 17 suppliers and verify their current Companies House status</li>\n        <li>Check whether contracts signed by companies with no directors are legally valid</li>\n        <li>Implement automated Companies House checks before any payment is processed</li>\n        <li>Publish the results of their review</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p><em>Companies House data accessed via the official API.
