They are the equivalent of household savings — the buffer that prevents a single bad year from becoming a financial crisis. For a small district council like Hyndburn, with a net revenue budget of approximately £17 million, healthy reserves are not a luxury but a necessity.</p>\n\n      <p>The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) does not set a minimum level of reserves, but advises that councils should maintain reserves sufficient to manage known risks. Most financial commentators suggest reserves equivalent to at least 5-10% of net revenue expenditure as a bare minimum, with many well-run councils holding significantly more.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Scale of the Collapse</h4>\n\n      <p>Hyndburn's reported reserve position tells a stark story:</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Metric</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Figure</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Usable reserves (prior year)</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£30,000,000</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Usable reserves (following year)</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£12,000,000</td></tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\"><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Single-year drawdown</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£18,000,000</strong></td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Drawdown as % of reserves</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>60%</strong></td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Drawdown relative to net revenue budget (~£17M)</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>106%</strong></td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>To put this in perspective: Hyndburn drew down more from reserves in a single year than its entire annual net revenue budget. This is not a minor fluctuation — it represents a fundamental shift in the council's financial position from relative comfort to potential crisis.</p>\n\n      <h4>How Hyndburn Compares to Its Neighbours</h4>\n\n      <p>Comparing reserve positions across the three East Lancashire district councils reveals that Hyndburn's position is notably weaker:</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Council</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Estimated Usable Reserves</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Net Revenue Budget</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Reserves as % of Budget</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Trend</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Burnley</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£20M</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£15M</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~133%</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Relatively stable</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Pendle</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£14M</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£14M</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~100%</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Declining</td></tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\"><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Hyndburn</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£12M</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£17M</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~71%</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Collapsed from ~176%</strong></td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>While all three councils face financial pressures, Hyndburn's trajectory is by far the most alarming. Burnley maintains reserves well above its annual budget. Pendle has seen depletion but not at the dramatic pace Hyndburn has experienced. Hyndburn has gone from the strongest reserves position in the group to the weakest in a single year.</p>\n\n      <h4>At Current Rates, Reserves Could Be Exhausted in 2-3 Years</h4>\n\n      <p>If Hyndburn continues to draw on reserves at anything approaching the recent rate, the mathematics are unforgiving:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>At the same drawdown rate (£18M/year), reserves would be <strong>exhausted within one further year</strong></li>\n        <li>Even at half the rate (£9M/year), reserves would be <strong>gone within 18 months</strong></li>\n        <li>At a quarter of the rate (£4.5M/year), reserves would last <strong>approximately 2.5 years</strong></li>\n        <li>Once reserves are gone, the council faces either emergency cuts, a Section 114 notice (effective bankruptcy), or emergency government intervention</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>A council that exhausts its reserves has no financial buffer whatsoever. Any unexpected cost — a legal claim, an emergency repair, a revenue shortfall — would immediately create a crisis.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Parkinson Legacy: 12 Years of Centralised Spending Decisions</h4>\n\n      <p>This reserves collapse did not happen in a vacuum. It occurred after <strong>12 years of leadership by Cllr Miles Parkinson</strong> (2011-2023), during which time decision-making at Hyndburn was highly centralised. Multiple sources indicate that Parkinson essentially decided most if not all major decisions with very little debate from the wider council.</p>\n\n      <p>This centralisation had direct consequences for financial management:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Fewer voices questioning spending:</strong> When one person dominates decisions for over a decade, the institutional capacity for challenge and scrutiny atrophies. Budget proposals that should have been rigorously debated were waved through</li>\n        <li><strong>The Wilson's Playing Field commitment:</strong> Parkinson personally championed the £12 million leisure trust capital investment at Wilson's Playing Field — a decision taken while reserves were already falling. Committing £12 million to a leisure trust that has never operated at a surplus, at a time when the council's financial position was deteriorating, represents a significant failure of financial judgment</li>\n        <li><strong>No succession of financial discipline:</strong> When Parkinson left the Labour Party in March 2022 to become an Independent, and then lost his seat entirely in May 2023, he left behind a council with depleted reserves and weakened governance structures. The financial consequences of his decisions fall on his successors</li>\n        <li><strong>Unauditable accounts:</strong> The very period during which reserves collapsed coincides with the period when Hyndburn's accounts became unauditable — receiving a disclaimer of opinion from external auditors. The council cannot even prove that the £18 million drawdown was spent on what it claims</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>Good leadership builds financial resilience. Parkinson's 12-year tenure delivered the opposite: a council that went from £30 million in reserves to £12 million, with no clean audit to verify where the money went.</p>\n\n      <h4>What Caused the £18 Million Drawdown?</h4>\n\n      <p>The specific expenditures that drove the £18 million drawdown have not been fully explained to the public. Potential contributing factors include:</p>\n\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>Capital programme commitments:</strong> Large projects like the Accrington Town Square regeneration and Wilson's Playing Field leisure investment</li>\n        <li><strong>Revenue budget pressures:</strong> Rising costs for waste collection, housing, and environmental services without corresponding income increases</li>\n        <li><strong>One-off costs:</strong> Potential severance payments, legal settlements, or project overspends</li>\n        <li><strong>Earmarked reserves releases:</strong> Money previously set aside for specific purposes being spent or reclassified</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p>Without a clean audit opinion, residents cannot verify which of these (or other) factors caused the collapse. This information gap is itself a governance failure.</p>\n\n      <h4>Questions the Council Must Answer</h4>\n\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>What is the current usable reserves position</strong> as of the most recent available date?</li>\n        <li><strong>What specific expenditures caused the £18 million drawdown?</strong> Provide a line-by-line breakdown</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the council's minimum reserves policy?</strong> Has it been breached?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the medium-term financial projection</strong> for reserves over the next 3-5 years?</li>\n        <li><strong>Has the council sought any external financial advice</strong> on its reserves position?</li>\n        <li><strong>What contingency plans exist</strong> if reserves are fully exhausted?</li>\n        <li><strong>Has the council considered issuing a Section 114 notice?</strong> If not, at what reserves level would this be considered?</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p>These are not unreasonable questions. They are the basic financial information that any resident, taxpayer, or business in Hyndburn is entitled to know. A council that cannot or will not answer them is a council that has lost its way.</p>\n\n      <p><em>Financial figures are based on publicly available budget documents, council reports, and estimates.
