Over £5.3 million across four years raises questions:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>Is the council regularly market-testing its insurance arrangements?</li>\n        <li>What is the broker's commission or fee on top of premiums?</li>\n        <li>How does Burnley's insurance cost per resident compare to similar councils?</li>\n        <li>What is the claims history — are premiums reflecting actual risk?</li>\n        <li>Could the council reduce costs through higher excess or self-insurance?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>With over £1.2 million per year on average, this is one of the council's larger recurring costs that deserves public scrutiny.</p>\n\n      <p><em>All figures are derived from publicly available council spending data.</em></p>\n    "
