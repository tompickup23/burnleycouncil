Why are legal fees being paid on purchase cards rather than through the normal procurement process?</p>\n\n      <h4>Food Delivery on the Taxpayer</h4>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Domino's Pizza:</strong> 3 transactions totalling £169 (all July 2024)</li>\n        <li><strong>Just Eat:</strong> 2 transactions totalling £155</li>\n        <li><strong>Uber:</strong> 2 transactions totalling £97</li>\n        <li><strong>Pizza Express:</strong> £36 (July 2024)</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>Three Domino's orders in a single month raises obvious questions about whether personal expenses are being charged to council cards.</p>\n\n      <h4>Streaming Subscriptions Running for Years</h4>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Netflix:</strong> 51 monthly payments since 2021 — £491 total</li>\n        <li><strong>Amazon Prime:</strong> 51 payments — £448 total</li>\n        <li><strong>Apple iCloud:</strong> 34 payments — ongoing since 2021</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>The Oversight Question</h4>\n\n      <p>Purchase cards exist for legitimate low-value purchases where raising a purchase order would be disproportionate. But with <strong>627 Amazon transactions (£29,619)</strong>, ongoing streaming subscriptions, and food delivery orders, the question is whether anyone is actually reviewing what goes on these cards.</p>\n\n      <p>The highest individual purchase card transaction was <strong>£8,998 to Wilkin Chapman</strong> — well above any reasonable \"low value\" threshold. Either purchase card policies are being flouted, or the policies themselves are too lax.</p>\n\n      <p><em>All figures derived from publicly available council purchase card data published under the Local Government Transparency Code.</em></p>\n    "
