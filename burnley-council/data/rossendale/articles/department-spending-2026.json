Between 2021/22 and 2025/26, the council allocated <strong>\u00a320,044,073.14 to Customer Services & E-Government</strong>, representing <strong>29.8%</strong> of its total \u00a367,293,350.95 expenditure.</p>\n\n<p>This allocation makes Customer Services the single largest departmental budget, surpassing even the combined total of Planning Services, Communities, Legal & Democratic Services, and Non-Distributed Costs. While this figure encompasses critical safety-net services including revenues and benefits administration, housing advice, and digital service provision, its scale invites scrutiny. For every \u00a3100 spent by Rossendale, nearly \u00a330 flows to this single department\u2014a proportion that exceeds the entire regeneration budget by almost double.</p>\n\n"
