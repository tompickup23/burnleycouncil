Rossendale has published 90 notices — but the data reveals a significant transparency gap.</p>\n\n<p>Of those 90 notices, only <strong>4 show an awarded contract value</strong>. This means that for 86 procurement exercises, the public record shows the opportunity was advertised but not whether a contract was let, to whom, or for how much. The procurement process effectively goes dark after the advertisement stage.</p>\n\n<h2>What Was Awarded</h2>\n\n<p>The four contracts with recorded values are all vehicle-related:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Motus Commercials:</strong> £178,245 — commercial vehicle purchase</li>\n  <li><strong>Motus Commercials Derby:</strong> £119,827 — another vehicle purchase</li>\n  <li><strong>NTM-GB Ltd:</strong> £108,109 — specialist vehicle/equipment</li>\n  <li><strong>Watling JCB Ltd:</strong> £23,575 — plant/equipment</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Together, these total <strong>£429,756</strong>. But Rossendale's total spending over the same period is £64 million — meaning less than 1% of spending is accounted for through published contract awards.</p>\n\n<h2>Why the Gap?</h2>\n\n<p>Several factors may explain the low award rate:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Below-threshold contracts:</strong> Many council contracts fall below the £30,000 threshold that triggers mandatory Contracts Finder publication</li>\n  <li><strong>Framework agreements:</strong> Purchases made through existing frameworks (e.g., Crown Commercial Service) may not generate individual award notices</li>\n  <li><strong>Administrative gaps:</strong> Updating Contracts Finder with award information is an additional step that may be deprioritised</li>\n  <li><strong>Outsourced procurement:</strong> If Capita handles procurement administration, award notices may fall between organisational boundaries</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The Trend</h2>\n\n<p>Publication activity has varied significantly by year. Activity peaked in 2023 with 18 notices and 2022 with 15. The pattern suggests fluctuating compliance rather than consistent transparency practice.</p>\n\n<h2>What You Can Do</h2>\n\n<div class=\"what-you-can-do\">\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Search Contracts Finder:</strong> Visit contractsfinder.service.gov.uk and search for Rossendale to see all published notices</li>\n    <li><strong>Submit an FOI request:</strong> Ask for a complete contracts register showing all current contracts, their values, and expiry dates</li>\n    <li><strong>Use the AI DOGE Procurement page:</strong> The new Contracts page shows all published notices with search, filtering, and analysis</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>"
