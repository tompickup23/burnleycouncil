  "content": "<h2>The Full Picture on Care Homes</h2>\n<p>When headlines screamed that Reform was \"closing care homes,\" the actual story was more nuanced — and the ending was one of democratic responsiveness that the previous administration never demonstrated.</p>\n\n<h3>What Reform Inherited</h3>\n<p>Lancashire's adult social care budget of approximately £545 million per year — over 40% of the council's entire net revenue — was under immense pressure. The previous Conservative administration had left a requirement to find £50 million in adult social care savings over 2025/26 and 2026/27. The council's CQC rating stood at \"Requires Improvement\" (2.0 out of 4) — joint-lowest of any county council in England.</p>\n<p>Reform did not create this crisis. They inherited it.</p>\n\n<h3>The Consultation</h3>\n<p>In the face of the £50 million savings requirement, the \"Living Better Lives in Lancashire\" transformation programme identified potential savings across the care system. Five residential care homes and five day centres were identified for potential closure — a saving of approximately £4.16 million annually.</p>\n<p>Rather than simply implementing these closures behind closed doors, Reform launched a full public consultation. Over 1,600 responses were received — one of the largest consultation exercises in the council's history.</p>\n\n<h3>Reform Listened — and Reversed</h3>\n<p>In January 2026, following the consultation, Reform announced that no care homes would close. Instead, the council pledged new investment in all five residential homes.</p>\n<p>This was not a U-turn born of weakness. It was an administration listening to residents and making a different decision based on the evidence presented. The contrast with the previous Conservative approach — which closed services with minimal consultation — is stark.</p>\n\n<h3>£23 Million Delivered Anyway</h3>\n<p>Despite keeping all care homes open, the Living Better Lives programme still delivered £23 million in savings during 2025/26, with a target of £46.75 million over two years. The savings are coming from better commissioning, reduced reliance on expensive agency placements, and more efficient use of in-house provision — not from closing services that vulnerable residents depend on.</p>\n\n<h3>What the Critics Conveniently Forget</h3>\n<p>Under Labour (2013-2017), Lancashire's adult social care budget was cut directly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical disability services: cut by 20%</li>\n<li>Learning disability services: cut by 15%</li>\n<li>Substance misuse services: cut by £500,000</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Under the Conservatives (2017-2025), the CQC rating deteriorated to \"Requires Improvement\" while council tax was maxed out year after year.</p>\n<p>Reform is the first administration in a decade to both protect frontline care services and deliver meaningful efficiency savings at the same time.</p>"
