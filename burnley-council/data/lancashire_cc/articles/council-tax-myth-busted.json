  "content": "<h2>The Claim vs The Data</h2>\n<p>Opposition critics and certain media outlets have claimed that Reform UK \"broke their promise\" on council tax at Lancashire County Council. Labour's Mark Clifford called the 3.80% rise \"a slap in the face.\" Azhar Ali called it \"a massive hit\" and accused Reform of breaking \"their one big promise.\" North West Bylines ran the headline: \"Reform to bin DOGE at Lancashire County Council and raise council tax instead.\"</p>\n<p>Here is the council tax record — every year, verified from official council minutes.</p>\n\n<h3>Council Tax History: Lancashire County Council</h3>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Year</th><th>Administration</th><th>Rise</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>2009/10–2012/13</td><td>Conservative</td><td>0%</td><td>4-year freeze (Band D: £1,108.30)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>2013/14</td><td>Conservative</td><td>−2.0%</td><td>Pre-election cut (Band D: £1,086.13).

Council officers calculated that this pre-election cut cost Lancashire £187 million cumulatively over the following decade through the compounding base effect.</p>\n<p>Labour inherited this reduced tax base when they won the 2013 elections. Faced with £262 million in government austerity cuts, they closed 40 libraries, cut 59 bus routes, shut 5 museums, and made over 1,500 staff redundant during their 2013-2017 minority administration — a crisis made worse by the Conservatives' pre-election council tax giveaway.</p>\n<p>Reform's 3.80% is the lowest in over a decade. It is not a broken promise — it is the most fiscally responsible council tax decision Lancashire has seen in years.</p>"
