  "content": "<h2>The Claim vs The Data</h2>\n<p>Opposition critics and certain media outlets have claimed that Reform UK \"broke their promise\" on council tax at Lancashire County Council. Labour's Mark Clifford called the 3.80% rise \"a slap in the face.\" Azhar Ali called it \"a massive hit\" and accused Reform of breaking \"their one big promise.\" North West Bylines ran the headline: \"Reform to bin DOGE at Lancashire County Council and raise council tax instead.\"</p>\n<p>Here is the council tax record — every year, verified from official council minutes.</p>\n\n<h3>Council Tax History: Lancashire County Council</h3>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Year</th><th>Administration</th><th>Rise</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>2016/17</td><td>Labour</td><td>3.99%</td><td>Minority administration</td></tr>\n<tr><td>2017/18</td><td>Conservative</td><td>3.99%</td><td>New administration</td></tr>\n<tr><td>2018/19</td><td>Conservative</td><td>5.99%</td><td>Highest ever rise in Lancashire history</td></tr>\n<tr><td>2019/20</td><td>Conservative</td><td>3.99%</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>2020/21</td><td>Conservative</td><td>3.99%</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>2021/22</td><td>Conservative</td><td>3.99%</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>2022/23</td><td>Conservative</td><td>3.99%</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>2023/24</td><td>Conservative</td><td>3.99%</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>2024/25</td><td>Conservative</td><td>4.99%</td><td>Maximum without referendum</td></tr>\n<tr><td>2025/26</td><td>Conservative (set before May handover)</td><td>4.99%</td><td>Maximum without referendum</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>2026/27</strong></td><td><strong>Reform UK</strong></td><td><strong>3.80%</strong></td><td><strong>Lowest rise in 12 years</strong></td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>The Inconvenient Facts</h3>\n<p><strong>Fact 1:</strong> The Conservatives raised council tax to the legal maximum without a referendum in both 2024/25 and 2025/26 — 4.99% each time.</p>\n<p><strong>Fact 2:</strong> Their 2018/19 rise of 5.99% remains the highest in Lancashire County Council history.</p>\n<p><strong>Fact 3:</strong> In 7 of their 8 years in control, the Conservatives applied the maximum or near-maximum council tax increase available.</p>\n<p><strong>Fact 4:</strong> Reform's 3.80% (1.8% core + 2.0% adult social care precept) is the lowest council tax rise Lancashire has seen since 2014/15.</p>\n<p><strong>Fact 5:</strong> Reform's rise is 1.19 percentage points below the previous year's rate — saving a Band D household approximately £20 per year compared to what the Conservatives would have charged.</p>\n\n<h3>The £40 Million Windfall Argument</h3>\n<p>Conservatives argue that Reform is \"£40 million per year better off\" due to improved pension fund performance and additional government funding, yet only reduced the council tax increase by approximately £8.2 million.</p>\n<p>This argument ignores that Reform inherited:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A £28 million projected overspend that had to be closed</li>\n<li>A £10.6 million outturn overspend from the previous year</li>\n<li>£93 million in additional demand pressures (£54 million service demand + £39 million inflation)</li>\n<li>A savings delivery rate of just 48% — meaning over £35 million in planned Conservative savings never materialised</li>\n<li>A DSG deficit of £95.5 million and rising</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The \"windfall\" was consumed by the financial crisis left behind.</p>\n\n<h3>What the Critics Won't Tell You</h3>\n<p>Azhar Ali — the current Opposition Leader attacking Reform over council tax — was in the Labour cabinet that cut council tax by 2% in 2013/14 as what he later admitted was \"a bribe.\" He himself estimated that cut cost the council £187 million over subsequent years.</p>\n<p>Labour closed 40 libraries, cut 59 bus routes, shut 5 museums, and made over 1,500 staff redundant during their 2013-2017 administration. Their 2% council tax cut was funded by cuts to services for the most vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Reform's 3.80% is the lowest in over a decade. It is not a broken promise — it is the most fiscally responsible council tax decision Lancashire has seen in years.</p>"
