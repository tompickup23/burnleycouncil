{"id": "cross-council-sr", "content": "<h2>The Partnership</h2><p>South Ribble and Chorley have shared senior leadership since 2008. But despite the shared management, their spending profiles tell different stories:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>South Ribble</th><th>Chorley</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Total Spend</td><td>£146M</td><td>£331M</td></tr><tr><td>Transactions</td><td>16,065</td><td>17,212</td></tr><tr><td>Avg Transaction</td><td>£9,085</td><td>£19,223</td></tr><tr><td>Top Supplier %</td><td>12.6% (LCC)</td><td>43.9% (LCC)</td></tr><tr><td>HHI</td><td>495 (Low)</td><td>2,131 (Moderate)</td></tr><tr><td>Council Tax</td><td>£236.78</td><td>£215.99</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Key Differences</h2><p>Chorley's spending is significantly more concentrated — its HHI of 2,131 is more than four times South Ribble's 495. This is largely driven by Chorley's much larger payments to Lancashire County Council (43.9% vs 12.6%).</p><p>South Ribble's average transaction size of £9,085 is less than half of Chorley's £19,223, suggesting more granular purchasing or different service delivery models.</p><p>Compare all eight councils on our <a href=\"/cross-council\">Cross-Council Comparison page</a>.</p>"}
