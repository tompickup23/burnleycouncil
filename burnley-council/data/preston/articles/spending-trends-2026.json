With a total spend of <strong>\u00a3205.9M</strong> across <strong>46,711</strong> transactions, the data reveals a significant increase in spending over the years.</p>\n<p>The data shows that the council's spending has been steadily increasing, with some fluctuations. The largest increase was seen from 2022 to 2023, with a rise of <strong>\u00a325.2M (108.7%)</strong>. This significant increase may be attributed to various factors, including changes in government policies, demographic shifts, or new infrastructure projects.</p>\n<p>It is essential to analyse the spending data in the context of the council's overall budget and financial plans. The data may indicate areas where the council is investing heavily, such as <strong>\u00a348.4M</strong> in 2023, and areas where spending has decreased, such as the <strong>\u00a33,957,662 (-8.2%)</strong> decrease from 2023 to 2024.</p>\n\n<h2>Year-by-Year Trends</h2>\n<p>A closer examination of the year-by-year trends reveals interesting patterns. The data shows that the council's spending increased by <strong>\u00a32.0M (14.7%)</strong> from 2019 to 2020, and by <strong>\u00a3396K (2.6%)</strong> from 2020 to 2021. However, the significant increase from 2022 to 2023, with a rise of <strong>\u00a325.2M (108.7%)</strong>, warrants further investigation.</p>\n<p>The following years saw a decrease in spending, with a drop of <strong>\u00a33,957,662 (-8.2%)</strong> from 2023 to 2024, followed by a modest increase of <strong>\u00a3943K (2.1%)</strong> from 2024 to 2025. These fluctuations may be attributed to changes in the council's budget allocation, new projects, or shifts in government policies.</p>\n<p>To better understand the trends, it is crucial to consider the overall change in spending from 2019 to 2025, which saw an increase of <strong>\u00a332.0M (238.9%)</strong>. This significant rise may indicate a shift in the council's priorities or a response to changing demographic needs.</p>\n\n<h2>Departmental Spending</h2>\n<p>Although the data does not provide a detailed breakdown of departmental spending, it is essential to consider how the council's spending is allocated across different departments. The significant increase in spending from 2022 to 2023 may be attributed to specific departments or projects.</p>\n<p>A comparison of the year-by-year spending may provide insights into the council's priorities and budget allocation.
