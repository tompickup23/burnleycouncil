This may involve exploring alternative suppliers, renegotiating contracts, and implementing more robust procurement practices.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the council should consider publishing more detailed information about its expenditure commitments, including the nature of the goods and services provided by each supplier. This would help to promote transparency and accountability, and provide citizens with a better understanding of how their money is being spent.</p>\n\n<h2>What You Can Do</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Submit a Freedom of Information request to Chorley Borough Council about the procurement processes and contracts with the top suppliers.</li>\n  <li>Attend council committee meetings to learn more about the council's expenditure commitments and procurement practices.</li>\n  <li>Check the council's published contracts register to see the details of the contracts with the top suppliers.</li>\n  <li>Write to your local councillor about your concerns regarding the concentration of spend among the top suppliers and the need for more transparent procurement practices.</li>\n  <li>Visit aidoge.co.uk to explore the full spending data and learn more about the council's expenditure commitments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<em>This article is based on Chorley Borough Council's published spending data covering 2024/25 to 2024/25.
