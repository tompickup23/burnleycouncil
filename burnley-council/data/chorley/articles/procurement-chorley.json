When a contract is published 322 days late, any opportunity for competitive challenge has long passed.</p><p>Of Chorley's 111 awarded contracts on the Contracts Finder portal, <strong>87 were published after their award date</strong>. While some delays may reflect administrative backlogs, the scale suggests systemic issues with procurement transparency.</p><h2>Category Monopolies</h2><p>Two suppliers hold monopoly positions in their respective categories: <strong>Pick Everard</strong> is the sole supplier for civil engineering services, while <strong>Field & Lawn</strong> is the sole provider of marquees and temporary structures. While this doesn't necessarily indicate poor practice, single-supplier categories warrant periodic market testing.</p><p>See our <a href=\"/procurement\">Procurement page</a> for full contract details.</p>"}
