This is reflected clearly in the spending data.</p><p><strong>South Ribble Borough Council</strong> is Chorley's third-largest supplier at <strong>£19.3 million</strong> (5.7% of total spend). Similarly, Chorley appears as a major supplier to South Ribble at <strong>£10.9 million</strong>.</p><h2>What's Shared</h2><p>The shared services model covers ICT, legal services, human resources, communications, and some planning functions. While the arrangement aims to deliver efficiencies, the cross-charging between councils makes it harder to assess true spending on individual services.</p><h2>Impact on Analysis</h2><p>When comparing Chorley and South Ribble to other Lancashire councils, it's important to account for these inter-council transfers. A significant portion of what appears as \"external spend\" is actually payment for shared internal services delivered by the partner council.</p><p>Compare both councils on our <a href=\"/cross-council\">Cross-Council Comparison page</a>.</p>"}
