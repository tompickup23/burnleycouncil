After filtering out 2,612 CSV republication artifacts (where quarterly data overlaps), our analysis identified <strong>26 groups</strong> of likely duplicate payments totalling <strong>£596,100</strong>.</p><p>These aren't necessarily errors — some may be legitimate recurring payments. But without invoice-level detail (which Lancaster doesn't publish), it's impossible to confirm whether these represent genuine duplicate payments or planned spending.</p><h2>The Split Payment Question</h2><p>We also flagged <strong>10 instances</strong> where multiple payments to the same supplier fell just below procurement thresholds within the same week, totalling <strong>£2.1 million</strong>. This pattern can indicate deliberate splitting of orders to avoid competitive tendering requirements, though it can also reflect genuine operational needs.</p><p>View the evidence on our <a href=\"/spending?ref=doge\">Spending page</a>.</p>"}
