This raises concerns about the lack of competitive markets and the concentration of spending with a few large suppliers.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>\n<p>The analysis of Wyre Council's spending data reveals a high concentration of spending with a few large suppliers. This raises concerns about the council's contract dependency and the lack of competitive markets.</p>\n<p>To address these concerns, Wyre Council should consider implementing measures to increase competition and reduce contract dependency. This could include breaking up large contracts into smaller lots, increasing the use of framework agreements, and promoting the use of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>\n<p>Additionally, Wyre Council should consider publishing more detailed information about its spending, including the breakdown of spending by department and the evaluation criteria used to award contracts. This would increase transparency and accountability and allow citizens to better understand how their money is being spent.</p>\n\n<h2>What You Can Do</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Submit a Freedom of Information request to Wyre Council about the evaluation criteria used to award contracts to the top 5 suppliers.</li>\n  <li>Attend council committee meetings, which are open to the public, to ask questions about the council's spending and contract management practices.</li>\n  <li>Check the council's published contracts register to see which contracts are due to expire and which suppliers are being used.</li>\n  <li>Write to your local councillor about the concerns raised by the concentration of spending with a few large suppliers and the lack of competitive markets.</li>\n  <li>Visit aidoge.co.uk to explore the full spending data and analyse the spending patterns of Wyre Council and other councils in Lancashire.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<em>This article is based on Wyre Council's published spending data covering 2017/18 to 2025/26.
