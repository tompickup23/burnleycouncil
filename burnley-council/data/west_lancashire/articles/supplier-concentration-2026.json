The top 5 suppliers, including <strong>WATES PROPERTY SERVICES LTD</strong>, <strong>TAWD VALLEY DEVELOPMENTS LTD</strong>, <strong>LANCASHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL</strong>, <strong>A CONNOLLY LTD</strong>, and <strong>PWLB</strong>, account for \u00a389.2M of the total spend.</p>\n<p>This concentration of spend raises questions about the council's contract management and procurement practices. The fact that <strong>WATES PROPERTY SERVICES LTD</strong> alone accounts for \u00a329.4M, or 8.8% of the total spend, suggests a significant level of dependency on this single supplier.</p>\n<p>The council's reliance on a small number of suppliers may also limit the opportunities for other businesses to compete for contracts, potentially reducing the overall value for money achieved by the council.</p>\n\n<h2>Analysis of Top Suppliers</h2>\n<p>The table below shows the top 10 suppliers to West Lancashire Borough Council, along with the total amount spent with each supplier and the percentage of the total spend.</p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Rank</th>\n      <th>Supplier</th>\n      <th>Amount</th>\n      <th>% of Total</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td><strong>WATES PROPERTY SERVICES LTD</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a329.4M</td>\n      <td>8.8%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td><strong>TAWD VALLEY DEVELOPMENTS LTD</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a321.0M</td>\n      <td>6.3%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td><strong>LANCASHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a316.5M</td>\n      <td>4.9%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td><strong>A CONNOLLY LTD</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a313.2M</td>\n      <td>4.0%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td><strong>PWLB</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a39.2M</td>\n      <td>2.8%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td><strong>ST MODWEN</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a38.1M</td>\n      <td>2.4%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td><strong>RIVERSIDE TRUCK RENTAL LTD</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a37.3M</td>\n      <td>2.2%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td><strong>RIBBLE VALLEY BOROUGH COUNCIL</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a36.6M</td>\n      <td>2.0%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td><strong>HEAT 2000 LTD</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a35.2M</td>\n      <td>1.6%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td><strong>ALLIANCE LEISURE SERVICES</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a34.9M</td>\n      <td>1.5%</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The data suggests that the council has a diverse range of suppliers, with no single supplier accounting for more than 8.8% of the total spend. However, the concentration of spend among the top 10 suppliers is still significant, with these suppliers accounting for \u00a3121.4M, or 36.5% of the total spend.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>\n<p>The analysis of West Lancashire Borough Council's spending data highlights the importance of effective contract management and procurement practices.
