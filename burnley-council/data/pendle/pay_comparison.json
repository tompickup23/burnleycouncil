Pendle deleted the Chief Executive post in 2015 to save £4M, replacing it with a Strategic Director role until 2021. The current CEO (Dean Langton) returned in October 2025 after previously serving as Head of Paid Service from 2015-2021. Pendle's 2023/24 accounts received a disclaimer of opinion as part of the national backstop exercise. Pendle does not report gender pay gap data (headcount ~200, below 250 threshold) due to extensive outsourcing to Liberata.",
