With 5,047 transactions averaging just £159 each, this represents roughly <strong>10% of all council transactions</strong> by volume. While fuel cards generate individual transaction records for each fill-up, the sheer volume raises questions:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>How many vehicles does the council operate that require 5,047 fuel transactions?</li>\n        <li>Could the council negotiate bulk fuel purchasing instead of individual card transactions?</li>\n        <li>Is there adequate oversight of fuel card usage to prevent personal use?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>£20.1 Million in Round-Number Payments</h4>\n\n      <p>We flagged <strong>774 payments over £5,000 that are exact round numbers</strong>, totalling £20.1 million. Round-number payments can indicate:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Estimates rather than actual costs</strong> — genuine invoices rarely come to exactly £10,000 or £50,000</li>\n        <li><strong>Budget transfers</strong> — moving money between accounts or departments</li>\n        <li><strong>Grants or contributions</strong> — which may be round figures by design</li>\n        <li><strong>Advance payments</strong> — paying an estimated amount before final costs are known</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>While not all round-number payments are problematic, the pattern is worth monitoring. Best practice is for councils to pay against actual invoices, not estimates.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Cross-Authority Transfers</h4>\n\n      <p>Two payments stand out for their size and unusual destination:</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Recipient</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Amount</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Question</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td><strong>Brentwood Borough Council</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>£3,000,000</strong></td><td>Why is a Lancashire council paying £3M to an Essex council?</td></tr>\n        <tr><td><strong>Surrey County Council</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>£3,000,000</strong></td><td>What service requires a £3M payment to a council 250 miles away?</td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>Cross-authority payments of this size are unusual for a district council with a total spend of £127 million. These two payments alone represent nearly 5% of all spending. Possible explanations include pooled investment schemes, pension fund transfers, or shared service arrangements — but the council should explain what these payments are for.</p>\n\n      <h4>Year-End Spending Surge: Financial Services</h4>\n\n      <p>Pendle's Financial Services department spent <strong>2.7 times its monthly average in March</strong>, representing £1.7 million above normal. While less extreme than Hyndburn's 12.9x spike, it still indicates budget-clearing behaviour at year-end.</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Council</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Worst Department</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">March Spike</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td>Hyndburn</td><td>Regeneration &amp; Housing</td><td style=\"text-align:right; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">12.9x</td></tr>\n        <tr><td><strong>Pendle</strong></td><td>Financial Services</td><td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>2.7x</strong></td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Burnley</td><td>Various</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">1.7x</td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <h4>What This Tells Us</h4>\n\n      <p>Pendle's spending patterns are characterised by <strong>high volume and low value</strong> — the opposite of Burnley, which has fewer but larger transactions. This creates different risks: less individual scrutiny per transaction, higher processing costs, and more opportunities for small errors to accumulate. The council should consider whether consolidating small payments could improve efficiency and oversight.</p>\n\n      <p><em>All figures derived from publicly available Pendle Borough Council spending data published under the Local Government Transparency Code.</em></p>\n    "
