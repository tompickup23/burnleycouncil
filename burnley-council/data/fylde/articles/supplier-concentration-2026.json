The large proportion of the total spend accounted for by these suppliers raises questions about concentration risk and contract dependency.</p>\n<p>The data also shows that the top 10 suppliers account for 44.0% of the total spend, with the remaining 56.0% being spent with 1,679 other suppliers. This suggests that while there are some large contracts with key suppliers, there is also a significant amount of spending with smaller suppliers.</p>\n\n<h2>Analysis of Top Suppliers</h2>\n<p>The table below shows the top 10 suppliers to Fylde Borough Council, along with the total spend and percentage of the total spend.</p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Rank</th>\n      <th>Supplier</th>\n      <th>Amount</th>\n      <th>% of Total</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td><strong>VBA JOINT VENTURE LTD</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a322.8M</td>\n      <td>14.5%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td><strong>BLACKPOOL COUNCIL</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a316.1M</td>\n      <td>10.2%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td><strong>MASTERSTAFF</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a36.6M</td>\n      <td>4.2%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td><strong>LANCASHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a35.1M</td>\n      <td>3.2%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td><strong>DENNIS EAGLE</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a34.8M</td>\n      <td>3.1%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td><strong>ERIC WRIGHT CIVIL ENGINEERING LTD</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a34.5M</td>\n      <td>2.9%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td><strong>ZURICH MUNICIPAL</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a32.4M</td>\n      <td>1.5%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td><strong>DANFO (UK) LTD</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a32.4M</td>\n      <td>1.5%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td><strong>F.
