The top 10 suppliers have received \u00a3639.9M, which is 36.9% of the total spend, highlighting the dependence on these suppliers.</p>\n<p>However, it is also worth noting that the remaining 6,085 suppliers have received \u00a31092.7M, which is 63.1% of the total spend. This suggests that the council is still able to distribute its spending across a wide range of suppliers, reducing the concentration risk.</p>\n<p>The council's spending with <strong>HMRC</strong> and <strong>TEACHERS PENSIONS</strong> is likely to be mandatory, as these organisations provide essential services. However, the spending with other suppliers, such as <strong>HOMECARE FOR YOU</strong> and <strong>GUARDIAN HOMECARE UK LTD</strong>, may be subject to more competitive tendering processes.</p>\n\n<h2>Competitive Markets and Contract Dependency</h2>\n<p>The council's contract dependency on certain suppliers may limit its ability to switch to alternative providers. However, the presence of a competitive market may help to drive down prices and improve services.</p>\n<p>The table below shows the top 5 suppliers to the council, along with the amount they have received and the percentage of the total spend.</p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Rank</th>\n      <th>Supplier</th>\n      <th>Amount</th>\n      <th>% of Total</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td><strong>HMRC</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a3174.4M</td>\n      <td>10.1%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td><strong>REDACTED</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a3127.4M</td>\n      <td>7.4%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td><strong>DD PAYMENT SUPPLIERS MAIN ACCOUNT</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a365.0M</td>\n      <td>3.8%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td><strong>TEACHERS PENSIONS</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a363.3M</td>\n      <td>3.7%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td><strong>HOMECARE FOR YOU</strong></td>\n      <td>\u00a339.8M</td>\n      <td>2.3%</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>What You Can Do</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Submit a Freedom of Information request to Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council about the council's contract dependency on certain suppliers.</li>\n  <li>Attend council committee meetings, which are open to the public, to learn more about the council's spending and contracting processes.</li>\n  <li>Check the council's published contracts register to see the details of current and past contracts.</li>\n  <li>Write to your local councillor about your concerns regarding the concentration of spending with a small number of suppliers.</li>\n  <li>Visit aidoge.co.uk to explore the full spending data and learn more about the council's finances.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<em>This article is based on Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council's published spending data covering 2020/21 to 2025/26.
