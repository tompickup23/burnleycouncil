The 2023/24 figures reflect a mid-year CEO changeover: Mick Cartledge retired 31 July 2023 and Lukman Patel took over from 11 August 2023, so neither individual crossed £100K for the year. Burnley was the only council in the entire UK with no employee earning over £100,000 in 2023/24 — explained entirely by the part-year split.",
