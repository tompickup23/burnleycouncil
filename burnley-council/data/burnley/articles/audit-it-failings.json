The absence of change management over the system that processes every financial transaction is a fundamental internal control failure. For a council managing £355 million in tracked spending, this should concern every resident.</p>\n\n      <h4>No IT Change Management: What Does This Mean?</h4>\n\n      <p>CIVICA Financials is the council's core accounting system. Every purchase order, payment, budget transfer, and financial report flows through it. It is the system of record for how public money is spent.</p>\n\n      <p><strong>IT change management</strong> is a basic control that governs:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>Who is authorised to make changes to the system</li>\n        <li>What changes are made, when, and why</li>\n        <li>How changes are tested before being implemented</li>\n        <li>How changes are reviewed and approved</li>\n        <li>How changes are rolled back if they cause problems</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>The external audit found that <strong>Burnley has no formal policy governing any of this</strong>. This is not an advanced or aspirational control — it is a basic requirement that most organisations of any size maintain. Its absence from a public body managing hundreds of millions of pounds is a significant red flag.</p>\n\n      <h4>What Could Go Wrong?</h4>\n\n      <p>Without IT change management, the following risks are uncontrolled:</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Risk</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Potential Consequence</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Without Change Management</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Unauthorised system changes</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Financial data modified without audit trail</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">No formal process to detect or prevent</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Untested modifications</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">System errors introduced into live environment</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">No requirement to test before deployment</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Configuration drift</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">System behaviour diverges from documented processes</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">No baseline to compare against</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Fraud or manipulation</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Payment approvals or limits could be altered</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">No change log to review</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">System failure</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Unable to identify what changed or roll back</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">No rollback procedures defined</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>To be clear: we are not suggesting any of these risks have materialised. But the absence of controls means <strong>the council cannot demonstrate they have not</strong>. That is the fundamental problem.</p>\n\n      <h4>Heritage Assets: £2.1M Underinsured</h4>\n\n      <p>The audit also found that the council's heritage assets are reportedly <strong>£2.1 million underinsured</strong>. Heritage assets include historic buildings, monuments, artworks, and other items of cultural significance that the council is responsible for maintaining and protecting.</p>\n\n      <p>Underinsurance means that if a heritage asset were damaged or destroyed, the insurance payout would not cover the cost of repair or replacement. The council — and therefore the taxpayer — would bear the shortfall.</p>\n\n      <h4>Full Audit Findings Summary</h4>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Audit Finding</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Severity</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Status</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Council Response</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">No IT change management policy for CIVICA Financials</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>High</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Open</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">To be implemented</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Heritage assets £2.1M underinsured</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Medium</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Open</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Under review</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <h4>Context: £355 Million in Tracked Spending</h4>\n\n      <p>The scale of the IT control gap must be understood in context. Our DOGE analysis has tracked <strong>£355 million in council spending</strong> flowing through the council's financial systems. Every penny of that has been processed by CIVICA Financials — the very system that lacks basic change management controls.</p>\n\n      <p>This is particularly concerning given our earlier findings of:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>£2.48 million in potential duplicate payments</strong> — could system configuration issues have contributed?</li>\n        <li><strong>Weekend payments on a single Sunday</strong> — was this a system batch processing error?</li>\n        <li><strong>Round number payments</strong> — could system defaults or configuration explain some of these?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>We are not drawing a direct causal link. But the absence of change management means these questions cannot be easily answered — because there is no audit trail of system changes to review.</p>\n\n      <h4>What Good Practice Looks Like</h4>\n\n      <p>A basic IT change management policy for a financial system should include:</p>\n\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>Change request process:</strong> All changes formally requested, documented, and justified</li>\n        <li><strong>Impact assessment:</strong> Potential effects of the change evaluated before implementation</li>\n        <li><strong>Approval workflow:</strong> Changes authorised by an appropriate manager, not the person requesting them</li>\n        <li><strong>Testing requirements:</strong> Changes tested in a non-production environment before go-live</li>\n        <li><strong>Implementation records:</strong> Who made the change, when, and what was changed</li>\n        <li><strong>Rollback plan:</strong> Documented process to reverse the change if problems arise</li>\n        <li><strong>Post-implementation review:</strong> Confirmation that the change worked as intended</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p>These are not onerous requirements. They are standard practice in any organisation that takes financial data integrity seriously.</p>\n\n      <h4>Questions That Need Answering</h4>\n\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>Has an IT change management policy been implemented since the audit finding?</strong> If so, when, and can it be published?</li>\n        <li><strong>What controls existed before the audit finding?</strong> Was there any informal process, or was this a complete gap?</li>\n        <li><strong>How many CIVICA users have administrator access?</strong> Who can make system-level changes?</li>\n        <li><strong>When was the last penetration test or IT security audit conducted?</strong> Has the system's security been independently assessed?</li>\n        <li><strong>Has the underinsurance of heritage assets been resolved?</strong> What additional premium was required?</li>\n        <li><strong>Were any other IT control weaknesses identified?</strong> Has the full audit report been published?</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p><em>This article is based on publicly available external audit findings for Burnley Borough Council.
