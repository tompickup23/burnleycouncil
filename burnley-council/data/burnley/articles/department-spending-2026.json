A departmental allocation of <strong>\u00a3137,542,805.16</strong>\u2014representing more than 38 pence of every pound spent by the council\u2014appears with no name, no description, and no identifying label.</p>\n\n<p>This unlabelled category, spread across five financial years from 2021/22 to 2025/26, exceeds the combined budgets of Planning & Transportation, Environmental Services, and Legal & Democratic services. For context, this single anonymous line item costs taxpayers more than the next three largest departments put together. In an era of local government transparency, the failure to identify where over one-third of the council's <strong>\u00a3355.2 million</strong> total expenditure flows represents a significant accountability gap.</p>\n\n<h2>Departmental Breakdown: Following the Money</h2>\n\n<p>The council's spending reveals stark disparities between service areas. While some departments command nine-figure sums, others operate on fractions of that amount. The following table presents the complete allocation of Burnley's budget across nine departmental categories:</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Department/Service Area</th>\n<th>Total Spend (\u00a3)</th>\n<th>Percentage of Budget</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>[Unnamed Department]</td>\n<td>137,542,805.16</td>\n<td>38.7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Planning & Transportation</td>\n<td>58,369,593.44</td>\n<td>16.4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Environmental Services</td>\n<td>35,712,722.46</td>\n<td>10.1%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Legal & Democratic</td>\n<td>35,264,028.11</td>\n<td>9.9%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Regeneration & Housing</td>\n<td>26,488,248.71</td>\n<td>7.5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other</td>\n<td>23,757,926.36</td>\n<td>6.7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resources & Finance</td>\n<td>20,103,842.85</td>\n<td>5.7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chief Executive & Corporate</td>\n<td>10,037,358.04</td>\n<td>2.8%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Leisure & Culture</td>\n<td>7,941,880.31</td>\n<td>2.2%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Administrative Weight vs Public Services</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most striking comparison emerges between the council's administrative machinery and its front-line services. Legal & Democratic services\u2014encompassing governance, elections, and committee administration\u2014cost <strong>\u00a335,264,028.11</strong>, consuming 9.9% of the total budget. This figure sits just <strong>\u00a3448,694.35</strong> below the <strong>\u00a335,712,722.46</strong> allocated to Environmental Services, which covers waste collection, street cleaning, and pollution control.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the Chief Executive & Corporate function\u2014covering senior leadership, communications, and corporate strategy\u2014absorbs <strong>\u00a310,037,358.04</strong>. This exceeds the entire Leisure & Culture budget of <strong>\u00a37,941,880.31</strong> by <strong>\u00a32,095,477.73</strong>. Residents might question whether corporate governance and executive functions should outrank libraries, parks, museums, and cultural programmes by such a margin, particularly when the latter constitutes the council's smallest named departmental spend at just 2.2% of the total.</p>\n\n<h2>Infrastructure and Growth</h2>\n\n<p>Planning & Transportation emerges as the council's second-largest expenditure at <strong>\u00a358,369,593.44</strong> (16."
