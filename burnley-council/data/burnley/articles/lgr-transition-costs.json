Councils are spending scarce reserves to argue about which council structure will be most efficient, while the cost of the argument itself reduces efficiency.</p>\n\n      <h4>What Is LGR?</h4>\n\n      <p>Local Government Reorganisation is the process of replacing Lancashire's current two-tier system (one county council plus twelve district councils, including Burnley) with a smaller number of unitary authorities that combine all functions. This is the <strong>biggest structural change to Lancashire governance in decades</strong>.</p>\n\n      <p>The Government has asked Lancashire to submit proposals, with a statutory consultation period running until 26 March 2026 and a target implementation date of <strong>April 2028</strong>.</p>\n\n      <h4>Burnley's Position</h4>\n\n      <p>Burnley Council is advocating for a <strong>five-unitary model</strong> — an option that would create five new unitary authorities across Lancashire, broadly preserving the current district council footprints in combined form. Critics argue this model primarily serves the interests of existing council leaders and officers by creating the maximum number of new authorities (and therefore the maximum number of senior positions).</p>\n\n      <p>The alternative — a <strong>two-unitary model</strong> — would create larger, more efficient authorities with greater economies of scale. Analysis suggests the two-unitary model would deliver significantly greater savings, but would result in fewer senior positions.</p>\n\n      <h4>What Is Burnley Spending on LGR?</h4>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Category</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Estimated Cost</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Notes</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">External Consultants</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Tens of thousands (est.)</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Financial modelling, governance advice, submission drafting</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Senior Officer Time</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Significant (unquantified)</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">CEO, senior management team, finance officers</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Legal Advice</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Unknown</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Constitutional, governance, and employment law</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Political Engagement</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Unknown</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Meetings, travel, lobbying activity</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Public Consultation</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Unknown</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Surveys, public events, communications</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Total LGR-Related Expenditure</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Not disclosed</strong></td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>No breakdown published</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>The lack of transparency around LGR spending is itself a concern. This is public money being used to advocate for a specific political outcome — the public has a right to know how much is being spent.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Irony</h4>\n\n      <p>The stated purpose of LGR is to create <strong>more efficient local government</strong> — to reduce duplication, cut overhead, and deliver better value for taxpayers. Yet the process of getting there is itself deeply inefficient:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>13 councils</strong> in Lancashire (12 districts plus the county) are each independently spending money on consultants, legal advice, and officer time to prepare competing submissions</li>\n        <li>Councils that will cease to exist are spending reserves that could otherwise transfer to the successor authority</li>\n        <li>Senior officers spending weeks on LGR submissions are not spending that time on delivering services to residents</li>\n        <li>The same financial modelling is being done multiple times by multiple consultants for multiple councils — the very definition of duplication</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>What Are Neighbours Spending?</h4>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Council</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">LGR Position</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">LGR Spending Disclosed?</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Burnley</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Five-unitary model</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; color:#ef4444;\">Not published</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Hyndburn</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Not publicly confirmed</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; color:#ef4444;\">Not published</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Pendle</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Joint approach with others</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; color:#ef4444;\">Not published</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Lancashire CC</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Two-unitary model</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem; color:#ef4444;\">Not published</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>The absence of published LGR spending data across all Lancashire councils is concerning. A coordinated FOI campaign would likely reveal the true cost of the LGR lobbying effort across the county.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Opportunity Cost</h4>\n\n      <p>Every pound spent on LGR lobbying is a pound not spent on services. Consider what the estimated LGR expenditure could fund instead:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>Additional street cleaning rounds</li>\n        <li>Parks and green space maintenance</li>\n        <li>Community safety initiatives</li>\n        <li>Housing enforcement officers</li>\n        <li>Anti-social behaviour interventions</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>At a time when the council faces a potential £5.6M funding gap, spending scarce resources on lobbying activity — however important the outcome — requires justification.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Reserves Question</h4>\n\n      <p>LGR consultancy fees are reportedly being paid from reserves. Burnley holds <strong>£25.8 million in earmarked reserves and £1.4 million in general fund reserves</strong>. Using reserves for LGR activity means those reserves are not available for:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>Bridging the business rates funding gap</li>\n        <li>Maintaining services during the transition period</li>\n        <li>Transfer to the successor unitary authority</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>Questions That Need Answering</h4>\n\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>What is the total LGR-related expenditure to date?</strong> A full breakdown by category should be published.</li>\n        <li><strong>Which consultants have been engaged?</strong> Names, contract values, and scope of work should be disclosed.</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the opportunity cost?</strong> What services or investments have been deferred to fund LGR activity?</li>\n        <li><strong>Is there a budget cap on LGR spending?</strong> Has the council set a limit on how much it will spend on the LGR process?</li>\n        <li><strong>Are any costs being shared with other councils?</strong> Is Burnley collaborating with other districts to reduce duplication?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the officer time cost?</strong> How many hours have senior staff spent on LGR, and what is the opportunity cost of that time?</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p><em>This article is based on publicly available information including council reports, committee minutes, and published spending data.
