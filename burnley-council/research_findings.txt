================================================================================
1. HEADLINE FINDINGS - THE MOST NEWSWORTHY ITEMS
================================================================================

1a. A SINGLE £19.8 MILLION PAYMENT TO GELDARDS SOLICITORS
    On 19 October 2021, Burnley Council made a single payment of £19,848,934.40
    to Geldards solicitors. This is by far the largest single transaction in the
    entire dataset. Total Geldards spending across 284 transactions is £21.4M.
    There is no description field for the largest payment. This requires urgent
    explanation - what was this payment for? Is it related to property
    acquisitions, compulsory purchase orders, or insurance claims?

1b. POTENTIAL DUPLICATE PAYMENTS WORTH £9.5 MILLION
    793 instances of same-day, same-amount payments to the same supplier were
    identified. While some may be legitimate (e.g., grant distributions), the
    pattern includes payments such as:
    - Barnfield Investment Properties: £982,507.52 paid TWICE on 11 June 2024
    - Maple Grove Developments: £1,214,386.72 paid on consecutive days
    - Lancashire CC: £1,125,547 and £1,125,546.75 on consecutive days
    - Lancashire CC: £974,739 and £974,739.40 on consecutive days

1c. £30 MILLION TOTAL LEGAL SPEND
    The council has spent £29.9 million on solicitors and legal services over
    the period. The top legal spenders are:
    - Geldards: £20.3 million (284 transactions)
    - Beachcroft LLP: £4.4 million (6 transactions)
    - Geldards LLP Cardiff: £950k
    - Harrison Drury Solicitors: £598k
    - DAC Beachcroft Claims: £542k
    This is an extraordinary amount for a small district council.

1d. 51 NETFLIX PAYMENTS ON COUNCIL PURCHASE CARDS
    The council has made 51 payments to Netflix totalling £490.73, charged to
    the Economy & Growth department. Also: 51 Amazon Prime payments (£448.49),
    34 Apple/iCloud payments (£43.36).

1e. £21 MILLION TO LIBERATA UK - ONE OUTSOURCING COMPANY
    Liberata receives roughly 10% of ALL council spending. The 10-year contract
    (from 2016) covers Customer Services, IT, Revenues & Benefits, FM & Property,
    HR admin & Payroll, and Environmental Health & Licensing.

1f. £609K ON HOTELS - INCLUDING TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION
    Payments to local hotels (Hill View Hotel: £163k, Rosehill Hotel: £73k,
    Molesworth Hotel: £59k, The Ormerod Hotel: £47k) appear to be for
    homelessness/temporary accommodation via the Housing & Development Control
    department.

Our dataset matches the published transparency data. We have compiled 30,580
total records covering spend, contracts, and purchase card transactions.

Transparency score: 99.8% data completeness.

================================================================================
3. THE £19.8 MILLION GELDARDS QUESTION
================================================================================

CRITICAL FINDING:
On 19 October 2021, a single payment of £19,848,934.40 was made to GELDARDS.
This is the largest single payment in the entire dataset.

There is NO description attached to this transaction. The department field is
also empty in the dataset.

Total Geldards spending: £21,395,540.35 across 284 transactions.
If the £19.8M payment is excluded, remaining Geldards spending is still £1.55M.

Geldards is a commercial law firm. A payment of this size from a district
council to solicitors is highly unusual and warrants investigation. Possible
explanations include:
- Property acquisition or compulsory purchase (related to Pioneer Place?)
- Insurance settlement pass-through
- Legal costs on major regeneration scheme
- Escrow/trust account transfer

But the lack of any description or categorisation is itself a transparency
concern.

ALSO NOTABLE: Beachcroft LLP received £3,196,923 in a single payment on
5 October 2023, and £793,337 on 22 December 2021. Total Beachcroft spending
is £4.4M across just 6 transactions. Beachcroft (now DAC Beachcroft) is an
insurance law firm, suggesting these may be insurance-related payments.

================================================================================
4. DUPLICATE PAYMENTS - UP TO £9.5 MILLION AT RISK
================================================================================

793 instances of same-day, same-amount payments to the same supplier.
Estimated total value of potential duplicates: £9,486,047.50

HIGH-VALUE POTENTIAL DUPLICATES (same amount, consecutive days):
- Barnfield Investment Properties: £982,507.52 x2 on 2024-06-11
  (Newtown Mill construction costs Valuation 20 - same description)
- Barnfield Investment Properties: £935,237.32 x2 on 2024-06-10/11
  (Newtown Mill construction costs Valuation 21)
- Barnfield Investment Properties: £820,130.52 x2 on 2024-06-24/07-01
  (Newtown Mill Valuation 22)
- Barnfield Investment Properties: £467,040.15 x2 on 2024-07-23/29
- Maple Grove Developments: £1,214,386.72 on 2022-09-13 AND 2022-09-14
  (Pioneer Place Valuation 8)
- Maple Grove Developments: £1,002,954 on 2023-03-14 AND £1,002,953.94 on 2023-03-15
- Lancashire CC: £1,125,547 on 2023-04-17 AND £1,125,546.75 on 2023-04-24
- Lancashire CC: £974,739 on 2023-01-27 AND £974,739.40 on 2023-01-31

NOTE: Some of these may be legitimate - one payment from the over-£500 dataset
and one from the contracts dataset could represent the same transaction reported
twice. However, the pattern requires investigation, particularly where amounts
are identical and descriptions match.

================================================================================
5. SENIOR OFFICER PAY (from 2023/24 Statement of Accounts, Note 22)
================================================================================

CHIEF EXECUTIVE:
- 2022/23: £119,039 salary + £3,970 election duties + £21,630 pension = £144,639
- 2023/24 (to 31/07/2023): £41,231 + £3,644 elections + £8,282 pension = £53,157
- 2023/24 (from 11/08/2023): £78,884 + £940 elections + £15,404 pension = £95,228
  Note: Change of Chief Executive during 2023/24. Full-year equivalent ~£120k.

CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER (Monitoring Officer):
- 2022/23: £94,449 + £1,495 elections + £16,549 pension = £112,493
- 2023/24 (to 10/08/2023): £35,056 + £1,458 elections + £6,635 pension = £43,149
- Head of Legal & Democratic Services (from 11/08/2023): £40,587 + £7,798 pension = £48,385

DIRECTOR OF RESOURCES (Chief Financial Officer):
- 2022/23 (as Head of Finance & Property): £77,952 + £13,720 pension = £91,672
- 2023/24: £80,295 + £513 elections + £15,577 pension = £96,385

CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER (from 11/08/2023 - new role):
- 2023/24: £62,263 + £324 elections + £12,080 pension = £74,667

DIRECTOR OF ECONOMY & GROWTH:
- 2022/23 (as Strategic Head): £77,579 + £13,654 pension = £91,233
- 2023/24: £81,380 + £15,577 pension = £96,957

HEAD OF POLICY AND ENGAGEMENT:
- 2022/23: £60,704 + £10,684 pension = £71,388
- 2023/24 (to 10/08/2023): £22,632 + £4,396 pension = £27,028
- 2023/24 (from 04/01/2024): £15,538 + £2,977 pension = £18,515

Pension contribution rate: 19.4% for 2023/24 (up from 17.6% in 2022/23)

ASSESSMENT: Senior pay at Burnley is relatively modest compared to larger
councils. The Chief Executive earns approximately £120k, which is below the
median for local authority chief executives (typically £140-180k). However,
for a small district council with only 243 employees, the management team
structure of 4 directors/chief officers plus support posts is notable.

WORKFORCE SIZE: Only 243 permanent/temporary employees as of March 2025.
Average salary: £36,922 (compared to UK average of £37,206).
Average salary for the local labour market: £29,508 (Centre for Cities 2024).
So council employees are paid 25% more than the local average.

================================================================================
6. TERMINATION BENEFITS & EXIT PACKAGES (Note 23)
================================================================================

2023/24: 1 compulsory departure in the £0-£20,000 band. Total cost: £2,000.
2022/23: Zero exit packages.

This is extremely low. No golden handshakes detected.

However, the Pension Strain Reserve stands at £1.113 million (unchanged from
2022/23 to 2023/24). This reserve exists to cover early retirement costs and
pension strain payments. The fact it has not been used suggests the council is
holding it as a buffer.

No redundancy payments were recorded in the reasons for leaving data for
2021/22, 2022/23, 2023/24, or 2024/25.

================================================================================
7. THE £21 MILLION LIBERATA CONTRACT
================================================================================

Total spending with Liberata UK Ltd: £21,183,056.07 across 363 transactions.
This represents approximately 10% of ALL council spending.

The contract was entered into in 2016 for 10 years, covering:
- Customer Services
- IT
- Revenues & Benefits
- Facilities Management & Property Services
- HR administration & Payroll
- Environmental Health & Licensing

Per the Productivity Plan, the council states:
"We are achieving the original cost reduction objective. The contract price
is fixed, so a 20% saving is forecast against the base costs in the final
years of the initial 10-year term."

Liberata also committed to creating 100+ new jobs in Burnley ("north-shoring").

Annual spend breakdown:
- Average of approximately £4.2M per year over 5 years.

CONCERNS:
- Concentration risk: 10% of all spending with one supplier
- Contract ends 2026 - what happens next with LGR?
- Staff are employed by Liberata, not the council, so the 243 headcount
  significantly understates the workforce delivering council services
- Pension guarantee risk: The council guarantees Liberata employees' pensions.
  If Liberata defaults, the council picks up the liability.

================================================================================
8. LEGAL FEES - £30 MILLION ON SOLICITORS
================================================================================

Total identified legal spending: £29,860,558.83

Top 10 legal suppliers:
1.  Geldards: £20,293,226 (includes £19.8M single payment)
2.  Beachcroft LLP: £4,406,071
3.  Geldards LLP Cardiff: £949,723
4.  Harrison Drury Solicitors: £597,715
5.  DAC Beachcroft Claims Ltd: £541,726
6.  Forbes Solicitors: £513,637
7.  Donald Race & Newton Solicitors: £678,817 (two different name formats)
8.  Hill Dickinson Solicitors: £350,000
9.  Barker Proudlove Ltd: £316,815
10. Wilkin Chapman LLP Solicitors: £255,723

Even excluding the anomalous £19.8M Geldards payment, legal spending is
approximately £10M over 5 years, or £2M per year. For a district council
with a net budget of £18.7M, this is significant.

================================================================================
9. BARNFIELD INVESTMENT PROPERTIES - £17.3 MILLION
================================================================================

Total spending: £17,343,321.67 across 69 transactions.
Third largest supplier overall.

Barnfield Investment Properties is a JOINT VENTURE PARTNER with the council.
The council has a 50% share of Barnfield and Burnley (Developments) Ltd.
The Council Leader and Chief Executive sit on its Board.

Primary spending relates to Newtown Mill construction/refurbishment:
- Multiple payments of £982k, £935k, £820k, £467k for construction valuations
- Total Newtown Mill recharges appear to exceed £10 million

POTENTIAL CONCERNS:
- Related party transactions: The council's Leader and CEO sit on the board
  of the joint venture company that receives £17.3M in council payments
- Multiple potential duplicate payments identified (see Section 4)
- Payments described as "recharge of construction costs" - is the council
  bearing the full construction risk?
- Limited competitive procurement if works go through the JV partner

From the Statement of Accounts (2023/24):
"In 2023/24 £2,776,497 (£1,829,317 in 2022/23) was paid to Barnfield
Investment Properties Ltd for the capital schemes at Newtown Mill."

Also: Barnfield Construction Ltd received £1,100 in 2023/24 (£7,000 in 2022/23).

================================================================================
10. PIONEER PLACE (MAPLE GROVE DEVELOPMENTS) - £16.6 MILLION
================================================================================

Total spending with Maple Grove Developments Ltd: £16,588,871.94 across 41
transactions.

Pioneer Place is a major town centre regeneration project on Curzon Street.
Payments span from 2021 to 2023, with descriptions including:
- "Development Agreement - Valuation 6 - Pioneer Place": £782,252
- "Pioneer Place - Valuation 7": £744,995
- "Pioneer Place - Valuation 8": £1,214,387
- Up to Valuation 16: £778,515
- "Legal fees for Pioneer Place": £1,176,908 (December 2021)

The project was funded partly through government grants (Levelling Up Fund
and other regeneration funding).

NOTE: The £1.18M "legal fees for Pioneer Place" paid to Maple Grove (not
to solicitors) is unusual. Why would a development company receive payment
for legal fees?

================================================================================
11. HOTEL SPENDING - TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION
================================================================================

Total hotel-related spending: £609,133

The largest hotel payments are NOT for staff travel. They are for TEMPORARY
ACCOMMODATION through the Housing & Development Control department:

Hill View Hotel: £163,619 (ongoing regular payments for accommodation)
Rosehill Hotel Ltd: £72,517
Molesworth Hotel Ltd: £59,064
The Ormerod Hotel: £47,309
The Lawrence Hotel: £38,687

Example descriptions from the contracts data:
- "invoice for accommodation covering from 24/09/2023 through to 06/01/2024"
- "accommodation covering May 2024"
- "accommodation covering April 2025 for [Redacted] 1/4/25 to 12/5/25..."

These are temporary housing placements, likely for homeless individuals or
families. The lack of descriptions on the purchase card payments makes it
difficult to distinguish accommodation costs from staff hotel stays.

Actual staff travel hotels (Travelodge, Premier Inn, Holiday Inn, etc.)
total approximately £53,652.

================================================================================
12. PURCHASE CARD SPENDING
================================================================================

Total purchase card spend: £610,168.44 across 6,671 transactions.
Average transaction: £91.47

YEAR-ON-YEAR TREND:
- 2021/22: £137,155
- 2022/23: £106,639
- 2023/24: £119,141
- 2024/25: £123,414
- 2025/26: £123,820

TOP RETAILERS (by spending):
- Asda Superstore: £22,606 (218 transactions)
- Argos: £16,274 (112 transactions)
- Travelodge: £16,151 (113 transactions)
- Amazon Marketplace: £14,031 (317 transactions)
- Premier Inn: £14,779 (90 transactions)
- Facebook/Meta: £10,773 (133 transactions)
- Currys/PC World: £11,588 (49 transactions)
- Trainline: £8,378 (150 transactions)
- Mailchimp: £8,679 (95 transactions)

STREAMING SUBSCRIPTIONS:
- Netflix: 51 payments, £490.73 (Economy & Growth department)
- Amazon Prime: 51 payments, £448.49
- Apple/iCloud: 34 payments, £43.36

SOCIAL MEDIA ADVERTISING:
- Facebook/Meta: 197 payments, £13,243
- Sprout Social (management tool): 48 payments, £13,285
- Snapchat: 68 payments, £1,110
- Twitter: 20 payments, £490
- Mailchimp (email marketing): 95 payments, £8,679

FREQUENT SMALL PURCHASES (under £100):
- Amazon: 425 transactions, £10,930
- Asda: 180 transactions, £7,679
- Tesco: 138 transactions, £2,922
- Timpson: 106 transactions, £2,855

ASSESSMENT: The Netflix and Amazon Prime subscriptions are the most
"tabloid-ready" findings, though the amounts are small. The social media
advertising spend (£36,807 total) and streaming subscriptions are the kind
of spending that generates public interest.

More concerning from a controls perspective is the volume of small Amazon
purchases (425 transactions under £100 = potential for personal use).

================================================================================
13. CONSULTANCY SPENDING
================================================================================

Total identified consultancy spend: £1,667,802 (per DOGE findings analysis)
Alternative figure from insights: £1,269,317 across 342 transactions

Top consultancy firms:
1. Black Cat Building Consultancy Ltd: £428,001
2. Mace Cost Consultancy Ltd: £172,814
3. FHP Property Consultants: £78,235
4. IS Consultancy UK Ltd (IS Group): £71,432
5. Carris Consulting Ltd: £44,820
6. D&S Knowles Consulting (Northern Reach): £37,500
7. Angela Vodden Associates Consulting: £32,850
8. 31ten Consulting Ltd: £32,500
9. Kapas Consultancy Ltd: £32,375
10. Adept Consulting Engineers: £30,738

Per the Productivity Plan: "The council has not had any consultants in its
employ for a year or more."

Per the Productivity Plan: "Agency costs are 1% of the overall wage bill
(£110k of £10.9m). Around half of this relates to employing seasonal staff."

================================================================================
14. COUNCIL RESERVES
================================================================================

From the 2023/24 Statement of Accounts:

GENERAL FUND BALANCE: £1,379,000 (maintained at prescribed MTFS level)

EARMARKED RESERVES (31 March 2024): £25,811,000 total
Key reserves include:
- Business Rates Retention Volatility: £570k (down from £9,212k in 2022)
- Revenue Support: £1,765k
- Carry Forwards: £603k
- Regeneration Reserve: £4,755k (up from £583k - large inflow)
- Pension Strain Reserve: £1,113k
- Charter Walk Regeneration: £1,929k
- Town Centre Master Plan: £1,092k
- Selective Licensing: £475k
- Revenue Grants Unapplied: £450k
- Charter Walk Refurbishment: £389k
- Covid-19/Cost of Living Reserve: amount not separately visible
- Transformation Reserve: exists per Productivity Plan

Total usable reserves: General Fund £1,379k + Earmarked £25,811k = £27,190k

ASSESSMENT: The council holds earmarked reserves roughly 1.4x its net revenue
budget of £18.7M. This is within normal range. The Business Rates Retention
reserve has dropped dramatically from £9.2M to £570k, which is notable. The
Regeneration Reserve has grown from £583k to £4.76M, suggesting funds are
being held for future capital/regeneration projects.

The General Fund balance of £1.379M represents approximately 7.4% of the net
budget - this is at the lower end of recommended levels (typically 5-10%).

================================================================================
15. INVESTMENT PROPERTIES & COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO
================================================================================

From the Statement of Accounts:

Investment property portfolio value:
- 31 March 2023: £8,713,000
- 31 March 2024: £9,218,000

2023/24 movements:
- Purchases: £2,250,000
- Net fair value losses: -£1,659,000
- Transfer from PPE: -£86,000

Investment property income:
- 2022/23: £2,031,000 rental income, £78k operating expenses = £1,953k net
- 2023/24: £843,000 rental income, £86k operating expenses = £757k net

The rental income dropped by 58% from £2.03M to £843k year-on-year.

The properties are described as "commercial units / office units" valued using
market approach.

CONCERN: The council spent £2.25M acquiring new investment property in 2023/24
while existing properties lost £1.66M in value. Rental income dropped by more
than half. This suggests the commercial property portfolio is underperforming.

Also notable: Charter Walk shopping centre features prominently in the
reserves (Charter Walk Refurbishment £389k, Charter Walk Regeneration £1.929M).

================================================================================
16. PARKING & RELATED INCOME
================================================================================

Parking-related spending from the data:
- International Parking Systems UK Ltd: £190,055 (parking systems/equipment)
- EB Charging Ltd: £101,755 (EV charging)
- Geoffrey Robinson Ltd: £58,847
- NX Consulting Ltd: £26,745
- NSL Ltd: £18,911 (parking enforcement)

The council's parking income is not visible in the spending data (which tracks
expenditure, not income). Parking income would appear in the annual accounts.

Note: The Fees and Charges report is published separately:
https://burnley.gov.uk -> Budget Book and Fees & Charges Tariff Report

================================================================================
17. AGENCY/TEMPORARY STAFF
================================================================================

Per the Productivity Plan:
"Agency costs are 1% of the overall wage bill (£110k of £10.9m). Around half
of this relates to employing seasonal staff, which is cheaper than employing
full-time staff."

From spending data (excluding Environment Agency which is not temp staff):
- Rapid Recruitment (SME Invoice Finance): £399,670 (over 5 years = ~£80k/yr)
- Vivid Resourcing: £27,808
- Castlefield Recruitment: £20,438
- G2 Recruitment Solutions: £19,979

Total identifiable agency/recruitment spend: ~£468,645 over 5 years

This is relatively low for a council. The Liberata contract absorbs much of
what would otherwise be staffing cost.

Per the Productivity Plan: "Trade Union facility time is negligible: it
equates to 0.06% of the total wage bill."

================================================================================
18. WASTE CONTRACT (URBASER)
================================================================================

Urbaser Ltd: £11,406,461 across 731 transactions (5th largest supplier)
FCC Environment/Urbaser Ltd: £3,982,347 across 243 transactions

Combined waste/recycling/street cleansing: ~£15.4 million over the period.

Per the Productivity Plan:
"The Council's waste, recycling and street cleansing service has been
contracted out since 1995. The current contract with Urbaser realized an
annual saving in excess of £585,000."

23. LGR / LANCASHIRE REORGANISATION
================================================================================

From the council's website (November 2025):
A proposal for FIVE UNITARY AUTHORITIES across Lancashire was submitted to the
Government for consideration on 27 November 2025.

Burnley Council's Executive met on 25 November 2025 to consider the submission.

IMPLICATIONS FOR BURNLEY:
- Burnley Borough Council would be abolished under LGR
- Services currently delivered directly and via Liberata would transfer to a
  new unitary authority
- The Liberata contract (ending 2026) coincides with LGR timing
- £25.8M in earmarked reserves could be subject to redistribution
- The joint venture with Barnfield would need to be resolved
- The £17.3M Newtown Mill investment and ongoing regeneration projects would
  transfer to the new authority
- Staff (243 permanent) would TUPE transfer

FINANCIAL RISKS:
- Pension guarantees for Liberata employees
- Outstanding borrowing: £56.1M (PWLB long-term + short-term)
- Capital Financing Requirement: £74.7M
- Unresolved commercial property portfolio performance

================================================================================

================================================================================
26. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION
================================================================================

1. URGENT: Obtain explanation for the £19.8M Geldards payment (19 Oct 2021).
   FOI request the invoice, contract, and committee decision authorising this.

2. URGENT: Investigate the apparent duplicate Barnfield and Maple Grove
   payments totalling several million pounds. These may be data artefacts
   (same payment in two datasets) but need verification.

3. Request the Liberata contract and any performance reviews. The contract
   ends in 2026 - what are the options? What are the true costs when pension
   guarantees are included?

4. FOI the Barnfield joint venture agreement and all Board meeting minutes.
   The Council Leader and CEO sitting on the board of a company receiving
   £17.3M from the council raises governance questions.

5. Request breakdown of the £843k investment property rental income vs. the
   £9.2M portfolio value. What is the yield? Why did income drop 58%?

6. Request the hotel accommodation spending with full descriptions. Are all
   the Hotel payments for statutory homelessness duties, or are there other
   uses?

7. Compare Burnley's per-capita spending on legal fees, consultancy, and
   outsourcing with similar-sized district councils.

8. Investigate the Beachcroft/DAC Beachcroft payments (£4.9M total, likely
   insurance-related). What claims are these for?

9. Review purchase card controls. 425 Amazon transactions under £100 and
   51 Netflix payments suggest weak oversight.

10. Examine the Regeneration Reserve growth from £583k to £4.76M. What is
    this being held for? Is it committed?
