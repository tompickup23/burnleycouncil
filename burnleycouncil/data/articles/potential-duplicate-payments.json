Either they have an extraordinary number of identical invoices, or something has gone wrong in the payment system.</p>\n\n      <h4>Near-Duplicates: Another £638,055</h4>\n\n      <p>Beyond exact duplicates, we found 289 \"near-duplicate\" pairs — same supplier, same amount, within 7 days but on different dates. The largest:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Post Office Ltd - Payout Fund:</strong> £100,000 on 5 June and £100,000 on 12 June 2023</li>\n        <li><strong>Post Office Ltd - Payout Fund:</strong> £99,999 on 18 Nov and £99,999 on 24 Nov 2022</li>\n        <li><strong>Calico Enterprise Ltd:</strong> £60,501 on 19 Nov and £60,501 on 20 Nov 2025</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>What This Could Mean</h4>\n\n      <p>There are two possibilities:</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>Data publishing errors:</strong> The council's transparency reporting system is duplicating records in the CSV files it publishes — meaning the data is unreliable</li>\n        <li><strong>Actual duplicate payments:</strong> The council is genuinely paying suppliers twice for the same work</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p>Either way, this represents a failure. If it's a data error, the council's transparency data cannot be trusted. If it's actual overpayment, £2.48 million of public money may have been wasted.</p>\n\n      <p><em>All figures derived from publicly available council spending data. Analysis methodology verified by cross-referencing raw CSV files against published quarterly returns.</em></p>\n    "
