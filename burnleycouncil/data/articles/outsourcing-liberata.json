This represents nearly 10% of all council spending analysed — an extraordinary concentration of public services in one private company's hands.</p>\n\n      <h4>What Liberata Does</h4>\n\n      <p>The 10-year contract (signed 2016, expiring 2026, total value ~£34M) covers core council functions:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Customer Services</strong> — the public contact centre</li>\n        <li><strong>IT</strong> — all technology infrastructure</li>\n        <li><strong>Revenues & Benefits</strong> — council tax billing, business rates, housing benefit</li>\n        <li><strong>Facilities Management & Property Services</strong></li>\n        <li><strong>HR Administration & Payroll</strong></li>\n        <li><strong>Environmental Health & Licensing</strong></li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>The Numbers in Context</h4>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Total to Liberata:</strong> £21,183,056</li>\n        <li><strong>Number of payments:</strong> 363</li>\n        <li><strong>Average payment:</strong> £58,354</li>\n        <li><strong>Share of total council spending:</strong> ~10%</li>\n        <li><strong>Council's own workforce:</strong> just 243 employees (with hundreds more working via Liberata)</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>The Council's Position</h4>\n\n      <p>The council's Productivity Plan (July 2024) states the contract is achieving its cost reduction objective, with a fixed price delivering a \"20% saving forecast against the base costs in the final years.\" Liberata committed to creating 100+ new jobs through \"north-shoring\" to Burnley.</p>\n\n      <h4>Questions for Scrutiny</h4>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>Has the claimed £8M saving over 10 years been independently verified?</li>\n        <li>The contract expires in 2026 — the same year LGR may abolish the council. What's the transition plan?</li>\n        <li>The council guarantees Liberata employees' pensions — what is this contingent liability worth?</li>\n        <li>With a General Fund reserve of just £1.379M, can the council afford the insourcing transition?</li>\n        <li>The Business Rates Retention Reserve has collapsed from £9.2M to £570K — is the financial position stable enough for major service changes?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p><em>All spending figures from publicly available council data.
