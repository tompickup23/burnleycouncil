## First Session

- Connected via WhatsApp
- Established identity: Gaius (AI assistant)
- User: Tom Pickup (call him Dominus privately)
- Communication style: sharp, concise, blunt
- Tom is new to coding and AI
- Timezone: Europe/London

## Tasks

- Sent message to Dave Dwyer (+447592231421) about Claude & Clawdbot
  - Dave is Reform UK politician, Lancashire Council cabinet member for data & digital
  - Message explained benefits for his role (policy drafting, data analysis, automation)
  - Initially sent manually by Tom, then resent via wacli after troubleshooting
  
## Troubleshooting

- Fixed wacli send issue:
  - Problem: Phone numbers with + prefix caused timeout ("context deadline exceeded")
  - Solution: Use JID format without +: `447592231421@s.whatsapp.net` instead of `+447592231421`
  - Format: `[country code][number]@s.whatsapp.net`
  - No need for sync running in background to send messages
  
- imsg requires Full Disk Access permission for Messages.app database
  - Needed to grant Full Disk Access to /opt/homebrew/bin/clawdbot-gateway (not just Terminal)
  - Tom sent initial test iMessage to Greg Rothwell manually
  - Successfully sent iMessage "test" to Greg Rothwell (+447817978522) via imsg CLI
