# 2026-02-05 - News Lancashire Setup

## Multi-Agent News System - Day 1

### Thurinus (Oracle VPS - 141.147.79.228) - PRIMARY SERVER
Successfully configured as main news aggregation server:

**Infrastructure:**
- Hugo static site generator installed
- Nginx web server configured
- SQLite database for article storage
- 42GB storage available

**RSS Crawler:**
- Hourly cron job fetching from:
  - BBC Lancashire
  - Lancashire Telegraph
  - Burnley Express
  - Blackpool Gazette
  - Lancaster Guardian
  - LEP (Preston)
- Location detection for Burnley, Blackpool, Preston, Lancaster
- 75 articles already collected

**Content Structure:**
- `/original/` - Tom's original reporting
- `/digest/` - AI-generated summaries (clearly labeled)
- `/guest/` - Guest posts
- `/burnley/` - Burnley-specific content

**Automation:**
- `easy-update.sh` - Menu-driven content management
- Social media scripts for Facebook/X (pending API keys)
- Build and deploy automation

**DNS:**
- Domain: newslancashire.co.uk
- Target IP: 141.147.79.228
- Status: Propagating (switched from Bluehost to Fasthosts nameservers)

**Pending:**
- SSL certificate (waiting for DNS propagation)
- Facebook/X API configuration
- Original content from Tom

### Octavianus (AWS t3.micro) - WORKER
- Currently unstable due to OOM (1GB RAM insufficient)
- Planned for Burnley filter and social automation
- Will retry as lightweight shell-only worker

### Dominus (Mac/Clawdbot)
- Orchestrates AI summary generation
- SSH access configured to Thurinus
- Will review exported articles and generate AI digests

## Key Decisions Made
1. Lightweight slave architecture (no OpenClaw on 1GB servers)
2. Hugo static site for performance and SEO
3. Clear separation: `/original/` vs `/digest/` for Google News compliance
4. Multi-agent workflow: Thurinus crawls, Dominus generates AI content, Tom reviews

## Next Steps
1. Wait for DNS propagation
2. Install SSL certificate
3. Write 2-3 original articles for credibility
4. Configure Facebook/X API keys
5. Apply for Google News inclusion (after 3 months of content)
