Twelve district councils and two upper-tier authorities will be merged into new unitary authorities. But behind the political arguments about how many unitaries to create lies a far more consequential question: what happens to the debts, contracts, reserves, and pension liabilities when councils merge?</strong></p>\n\n      <h4>What Is LGR and Why Does It Matter?</h4>\n\n      <p>Local Government Reorganisation replaces the current two-tier system (county council + district councils) with single-tier unitary authorities that deliver all services. In Lancashire, this means abolishing:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Lancashire County Council</strong> (upper tier — highways, education, social care, waste disposal)</li>\n        <li><strong>12 district councils</strong> including Burnley, Pendle, and Hyndburn (lower tier — planning, housing, revenues, waste collection)</li>\n        <li><strong>2 existing unitary authorities</strong> — Blackpool and Blackburn with Darwen</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>These will be replaced by a smaller number of new unitary authorities. The question of whether Lancashire gets two, three, four, or five unitaries is politically contentious — but the financial implications of each model are what residents should actually care about.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Financial Baggage: What Each Council Brings to the Table</h4>\n\n      <p>Every council entering LGR carries a different financial profile. When councils merge, the successor authority inherits <strong>all</strong> the assets and liabilities of its predecessors. This is not optional — it is a legal requirement under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007.</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Council</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Estimated Debt</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Usable Reserves</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Major Contracts / Liabilities</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Key Risk</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Burnley</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£80M+</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£20M</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Charter Walk, Pioneer Place commercial debt; FCC waste contract 2026-2034</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Commercial property risk</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Pendle</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£15-20M</td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£14M</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Liberata £54M outsourcing; PEARL joint venture; budget gap</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Outsourcing dependency</td></tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\"><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Hyndburn</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£20-25M</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>~£12M</strong></td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Leisure trust subsidy (~£1M/yr); Wilson's Playing Field £12M; unaudited accounts</strong></td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\"><strong>Reserves depletion + audit failure</strong></td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p><em>Note: Exact debt figures vary depending on classification (PWLB borrowing, internal borrowing, finance leases, PFI liabilities). These are estimates based on available public data.</em></p>\n\n      <h4>The Five Key LGR Financial Questions</h4>\n\n      <h4>1. Debt: Who Pays for Whose Borrowing?</h4>\n\n      <p>Each council has borrowed different amounts for different purposes. Burnley carries significant commercial property debt from investments like Charter Walk shopping centre and the Pioneer Place development. Hyndburn has borrowed for regeneration projects. Pendle has the ongoing Liberata commitment.</p>\n\n      <p>When these councils merge into a unitary authority, <strong>the new body inherits all the debt</strong>. A well-managed district that kept borrowing low finds itself suddenly liable for a neighbour's commercial property gamble or leisure trust overcommitment. There is no mechanism for residents of one former district to avoid paying for another district's debts.</p>\n\n      <h4>2. Contracts: Locked In for Years Beyond the Merger</h4>\n\n      <p>Long-term contracts do not dissolve when councils merge. They transfer to the successor authority. This creates significant complications:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Pendle's Liberata contract</strong> commits potentially millions per year to a single outsourcing provider — the new unitary inherits this commitment regardless of whether other merging councils run equivalent services in-house</li>\n        <li><strong>Burnley's FCC waste collection contract</strong> runs from 2026 to 2034 — an 8-year commitment the successor authority must honour</li>\n        <li><strong>Hyndburn's leisure trust arrangements</strong> — including the reported £1M annual subsidy and £12M Wilson's Playing Field capital ask — become the new authority's problem</li>\n        <li><strong>Contradictory approaches:</strong> The new unitary could inherit one district's outsourced Liberata contract alongside another district's in-house service delivery team, doing the same work at different costs under different management structures</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>3. Reserves: Pooling Means Subsidising</h4>\n\n      <p>Council reserves are pooled when authorities merge. This means:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>Burnley's relatively healthy reserves (~£20M, ~133% of net budget) get merged with Hyndburn's depleted reserves (~£12M, ~71% of net budget after a £18M single-year collapse)</li>\n        <li>Well-managed councils effectively <strong>subsidise the financial failures of poorly-managed neighbours</strong></li>\n        <li>There is a perverse incentive for councils to <strong>spend down reserves before the merger</strong> — why save money if it will be pooled with councils that did not?</li>\n        <li>Some councils may accelerate capital projects or pay off liabilities before LGR to ensure their reserves benefit their own residents rather than being absorbed into a wider pool</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>4. Staff: Massive Redundancy Costs</h4>\n\n      <p>Twelve district councils means twelve chief executives, twelve finance directors, twelve heads of planning, twelve legal teams, twelve HR departments. A unitary authority needs one of each. The maths is brutal:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Redundancy costs</strong> for senior officers alone could run into tens of millions across the county</li>\n        <li><strong>TUPE regulations</strong> protect staff during transfers, but do not prevent subsequent restructuring and redundancy</li>\n        <li><strong>Knowledge loss:</strong> Experienced officers who take redundancy take their institutional knowledge with them</li>\n        <li><strong>Transition period:</strong> For 1-2 years, the new authority will be running parallel systems, dual management structures, and overlapping teams while integration happens — at enormous cost</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>5. Pension Liabilities: The Hidden Timebomb</h4>\n\n      <p>Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) obligations are among the largest liabilities any council carries. Each council has a different funding position within the Lancashire County Pension Fund. When councils merge:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>Pension deficits from one council become the responsibility of the successor authority</li>\n        <li>Different employer contribution rates must be harmonised — potentially increasing costs for formerly lower-paying councils</li>\n        <li>Past service deficits accumulated over decades transfer in full to the new body</li>\n        <li>The actuarial impact of LGR on pension fund investment strategy has not been publicly modelled</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>Lessons from Previous LGR Rounds</h4>\n\n      <p>Lancashire is not the first county to undergo reorganisation. Recent examples provide cautionary tales:</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Area</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Year</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">What Happened</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Lesson for Lancashire</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Northamptonshire</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2021</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">County council went effectively bankrupt (Section 114 notice). Two new unitaries created from the wreckage inherited massive debts and depleted reserves</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Financial failures transfer to successor bodies. Residents of well-managed districts paid for county-level failures</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Cumbria</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2023</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Split into Cumberland and Westmorland & Furness. Transition costs estimated at £25-40M. Legacy contracts and IT systems created integration headaches</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Transition costs are always higher than estimated. IT integration alone can take 3-5 years</td></tr>\n        <tr><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Somerset</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2023</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Four districts merged into single unitary. Redundancy costs, reserves pooling, and contract rationalisation dominated the first year</td><td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">The first 2-3 years of a new unitary are consumed by reorganisation, not service improvement</td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>The consistent lesson: <strong>LGR is expensive, disruptive, and takes years to deliver promised savings.</strong> The financial modelling almost always underestimates transition costs and overestimates efficiency gains. Residents should be sceptical of any politician promising LGR will save them money in the short term.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Political Dimension</h4>\n\n      <p>Different LGR models create different groupings — and therefore different combinations of debts, assets, and liabilities:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>A two-unitary model</strong> creates larger authorities that pool more debts but also more assets and offer greater economies of scale</li>\n        <li><strong>A five-unitary model</strong> (favoured by some district councils including Burnley) keeps authorities smaller but limits efficiency gains and may group debt-heavy districts together</li>\n        <li><strong>Which districts are grouped together matters enormously:</strong> a unitary combining Burnley's commercial property debt with Hyndburn's reserves depletion and Pendle's outsourcing dependency would start life with a challenging financial inheritance</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>Residents should ask their council leaders not which model preserves their political jobs, but which model creates the strongest financial foundation for the new authority.</p>\n\n      <h4>Why Residents Should Care Now</h4>\n\n      <p>The decisions being made about LGR in the next 12-24 months will determine the financial health of local government in Lancashire for the next generation. Once councils merge:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>There is <strong>no going back</strong> — the old districts are abolished permanently</li>\n        <li>All financial commitments — good and bad — become shared liabilities</li>\n        <li>Council tax levels will eventually be harmonised, meaning some residents will pay more</li>\n        <li>Service levels will be rationalised, meaning some areas may lose services they currently have</li>\n        <li>The transition period (2-3 years minimum) will divert management attention and resources away from front-line services</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>Questions That Must Be Answered Before LGR Proceeds</h4>\n\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>What financial modelling has been done</strong> for each proposed LGR scenario? Has this been independently verified?</li>\n        <li><strong>What are the estimated transition costs</strong> — including redundancy, IT integration, contract renegotiation, and governance setup?</li>\n        <li><strong>How will legacy debts be allocated?</strong> Will residents of one former district pay for another's borrowing?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the plan for conflicting contracts?</strong> How does a new unitary manage one inherited Liberata outsourcing contract alongside inherited in-house teams?</li>\n        <li><strong>What happens to reserves?</strong> Will councils be required to maintain minimum reserve levels to prevent pre-merger spending sprees?</li>\n        <li><strong>What are the pension fund implications?</strong> Has the Lancashire County Pension Fund modelled the actuarial impact?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the realistic timeline for savings?</strong> When will residents actually see lower costs rather than higher transition costs?</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p>LGR is coming to Lancashire. The question is not whether councils will merge, but how — and whether residents are given honest answers about the financial consequences before it happens.</p>\n\n      <p><em>Financial figures are estimates based on publicly available council accounts, budget documents, and transparency data.
