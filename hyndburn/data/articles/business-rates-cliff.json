For a small district council already under pressure, this is potentially existential.</p>\n\n      <h4>What Is Happening?</h4>\n\n      <p>The central government is resetting the business rates retention system. Since 2013, councils have been allowed to keep a portion of the business rates growth generated locally. Burnley, through economic development and growth in its business base, accumulated approximately £2.2 million per year in retained growth.</p>\n\n      <p>The reset wipes this accumulated growth away. From April 2026, the baseline is recalculated, and Burnley starts again from zero. The money does not disappear from the system — it is redistributed nationally — but for Burnley specifically, it represents a <strong>direct income loss of £2.2 million per year</strong>.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Combined Funding Gap</h4>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Year</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Business Rates Income</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Government Grant</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Total Funding</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Budget Gap</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Cumulative Pressure</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2024/25</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">£8.1M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">£2.2M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">£19.0M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">—</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">—</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2025/26</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">£6.4M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">£2.2M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">£18.7M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£0.8M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£0.8M</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2026/27</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£4.2M (est.)</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£2.3M (est.)</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£15.0M (est.)</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£2.2M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£3.0M</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2027/28</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£4.0M (est.)</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£2.1M (est.)</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£14.5M (est.)</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£1.3M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£4.3M</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr style=\"background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\">\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">2028/29</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£3.8M (est.)</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£2.0M (est.)</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£14.0M (est.)</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£1.3M</td>\n          <td style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">~£5.6M</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <p>The trajectory is clear. Over three years, cumulative budget pressure of approximately <strong>£5.6 million</strong> builds against a shrinking budget. That is not a gap that can be closed with efficiency savings alone.</p>\n\n      <h4>Why Burnley Is Particularly Vulnerable</h4>\n\n      <p>Not all councils are equally affected by the business rates reset. Burnley is particularly exposed because:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>High reliance on retained business rates:</strong> Business rates formed a larger share of Burnley's income than many comparable councils, meaning the reset removes a proportionally larger income stream</li>\n        <li><strong>Limited council tax base:</strong> With high levels of deprivation, a large proportion of Band A properties, and significant council tax support costs, there is limited room to raise additional income through council tax</li>\n        <li><strong>Small budget base:</strong> A net revenue budget of ~£15M leaves very little room for absorption — every £1M lost represents roughly 6.7% of total spending power</li>\n        <li><strong>Existing debt commitments:</strong> Debt servicing from commercial property investments (Charter Walk, Pioneer Place) consumes budget that is no longer flexible</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>The government's own analysis shows that <strong>67-70% of shire district councils</strong> will see real-terms funding fall over the 2026-2029 period. Burnley is not alone — but its specific combination of factors makes it one of the most vulnerable.</p>\n\n      <h4>What Are the Options?</h4>\n\n      <p>The council has limited options to address a gap of this magnitude:</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Option</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Potential Scale</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Consequences</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Council Tax Increases</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">~£250K per year (at max 3%)</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Limited impact; affects most deprived residents</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Service Cuts</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Variable</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Direct impact on residents; political cost</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Use of Reserves</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">£25.8M earmarked + £1.4M general</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">One-off; not sustainable; leaves successor authority exposed</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Asset Sales</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Variable (Charter Walk?)</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Likely at a loss; reduces future income</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Merger via LGR</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Fundamental restructuring</td>\n          <td style=\"padding: 0.5rem;\">Burnley's problems become the new authority's problems</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <h4>The LGR Factor</h4>\n\n      <p>If Lancashire reorganises into unitary authorities — which is the government's stated intention, with a target date of <strong>April 2028</strong> — then Burnley Borough Council ceases to exist. Its financial position, reserves, debts, and obligations transfer to the successor authority.</p>\n\n      <p>This creates a perverse incentive: <strong>why make painful spending cuts now if the council will not exist in two years?</strong> The temptation to run down reserves and defer difficult decisions is real — but doing so would leave the new unitary authority in a worse financial position from day one.</p>\n\n      <p>Conversely, if LGR is delayed or does not happen, Burnley must deal with this funding gap on its own. The council cannot afford to plan for LGR rescue and simultaneously fail to plan for independent survival.</p>\n\n      <h4>37% of Spending Power at Risk</h4>\n\n      <p>The headline figure bears repeating: a cumulative funding gap of approximately <strong>£5.6 million against a net revenue budget of ~£15 million represents roughly 37% of the council's spending power</strong>. No amount of efficiency savings or marginal adjustments can close a gap of this scale. This requires fundamental decisions about what services the council can continue to provide.</p>\n\n      <h4>Questions That Need Answering</h4>\n\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>What financial modelling has the council undertaken?</strong> Has a formal multi-year financial plan been published showing how the gap will be closed?</li>\n        <li><strong>Which services are at risk?</strong> If cuts are required, what are the priorities and what is the impact assessment?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the council's contingency plan?</strong> If LGR is delayed, how will the council remain solvent?</li>\n        <li><strong>Has a formal funding gap report been published?</strong> The public has a right to see the full financial picture.</li>\n        <li><strong>What reserves drawdown strategy is in place?</strong> How much of the £25.8M in earmarked reserves is genuinely available?</li>\n        <li><strong>What representations has the council made to government?</strong> Has the specific impact on Burnley been formally raised with DLUHC?</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p><em>This article is based on publicly available information including the Provisional Local Government Finance Settlement 2026-29, Burnley Council Budget Book 2025-26, and council financial forecasts.
