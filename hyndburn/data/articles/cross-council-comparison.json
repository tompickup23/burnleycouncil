This reflects the two-tier local government structure where district councils pay the county for services like highways, social care, and waste disposal. But the sheer scale warrants scrutiny: are these inter-authority charges competitive, or simply accepted without challenge?</p>\n\n      <h4>Cross-Council Comparison Dashboard</h4>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Metric</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Hyndburn</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Burnley</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Pendle</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td>Total spend</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£211M</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£217M</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£127M</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Transactions</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">29,802</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">19,865</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">48,785</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Avg transaction</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£7,080</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£11,616</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£2,604</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>CH breach payments</td><td style=\"text-align:right; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\"><strong>£1,100,000</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£223,900</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£37,800</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Duplicate value</td><td style=\"text-align:right; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\"><strong>£3,400,000</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£2,478,616</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£2,700,000</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Split payments</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£14,800,000</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">—</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£19,500,000</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Year-end spike</td><td style=\"text-align:right; background: rgba(255,69,58,0.2);\"><strong>12.9x</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:right\">1.7x</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">2.7x</td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Hyndburn has the worst Companies House compliance</strong> — £1.1M to non-compliant suppliers, nearly 5x Burnley's exposure</li>\n        <li><strong>Hyndburn has the worst year-end spike</strong> — at 12.9x, it dwarfs both neighbours</li>\n        <li><strong>Hyndburn has the highest duplicate value</strong> — £3.4M, nearly £1M more than Burnley</li>\n        <li><strong>Pendle processes the most transactions</strong> — 48,785 at an average of just £2,604, suggesting different administrative practices</li>\n        <li><strong>37 shared suppliers</strong> — with price variations that could indicate procurement inefficiency</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>The Case for Joint Procurement</h4>\n\n      <p>With 37 suppliers already shared between the councils, there is a clear opportunity for joint procurement. If all three councils negotiated collectively with their shared suppliers, the combined spending power of £28.1 million would likely deliver better rates for all residents.</p>\n\n      <p><em>Cross-council analysis based on publicly available spending data from Hyndburn, Burnley, and Pendle Borough Councils.
