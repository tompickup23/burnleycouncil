While councils can use legal panels and frameworks, the Local Government Transparency Code requires all expenditure over £5,000 to have associated contract details published.</p>\n\n      <p>Beachcroft LLP stands out: <strong>£4.4 million in just 6 payments</strong> — an average of £734,345 per payment — with no contract on the register. Their largest single payment was £3.2 million on 5 October 2023, categorised as \"New Constructions\".</p>\n\n      <h4>Energy Costs Hidden</h4>\n\n      <p>EDF Energy has received £3.17 million across 127 payments with no contract published. While energy supply is essential, a contract of this value should absolutely appear on the contracts register.</p>\n\n      <h4>The 666-Payment Agency</h4>\n\n      <p>Rapid Recruitment has received 666 separate payments averaging just £600 each, totalling £399,670 — all without a published contract. This volume of payments to a single agency raises questions about whether temporary staffing has become a permanent arrangement without proper procurement.</p>\n\n      <h4>Legal Requirement</h4>\n\n      <p>Under the Local Government Transparency Code 2015, councils must publish details of all contracts and commissioned activity over £5,000 including:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Reference number</li>\n        <li>Title and description</li>\n        <li>Supplier name</li>\n        <li>Total value</li>\n        <li>Start and end dates</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>£10.5 million in spending without corresponding contract publications is a transparency failure that requires explanation.</p>\n\n      <p><em>All figures derived from cross-referencing publicly available spending data against the council's published contracts register.</em></p>\n    "
