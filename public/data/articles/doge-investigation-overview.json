Inspired by the push for government efficiency reviews — the UK's Office for Value for Money was established in the October 2024 Autumn Budget, while the National Audit Office and CIPFA have long called for better local government scrutiny — this is a citizen-led analysis of how Burnley spends public money. The results are concerning.</p>\n\n      <p>This analysis covers both <strong>revenue spending</strong> (day-to-day running costs from the ~£18.7M annual budget) and <strong>capital spending</strong> (one-off investments like Pioneer Place, funded by borrowing within the ~£42.5M five-year capital programme).</p>\n\n      <h4>The Headline Numbers</h4>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Finding</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Value</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td>Exact duplicate payments (same supplier, amount, date)</td><td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>£2,478,616</strong></td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Near-duplicate payments (within 7 days)</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£638,055</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Top suppliers with no contract on file</td><td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>£10,521,243</strong></td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Round number payments (£5k+)</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£19,829,000</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Purchase card spending</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£596,367</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Weekend payments (mostly one Sunday)</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£71,810</td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <h4>1. Exact Duplicate Payments: £2.48 Million</h4>\n\n      <p>We found <strong>1,284 records in 503 duplicate groups</strong> where the same supplier received the same amount on the same date. Our investigation confirmed these duplicates originate in the council's own published CSV files — they are not artefacts of our data processing.</p>\n\n      <p>The largest duplicates include:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Total Pool Chemicals Ltd:</strong> £491,252 (identical payments with no date recorded)</li>\n        <li><strong>FCC Environment/Urbaser Ltd:</strong> £141,630 (2 identical payments on 8 July 2025)</li>\n        <li><strong>Urbaser Limited:</strong> £133,516 (2 identical on 30 October 2023)</li>\n        <li><strong>Transdev Blazefield Ltd:</strong> £130,209 (11 identical payments of £11,837 on 2 November 2021)</li>\n        <li><strong>Burnley Leisure:</strong> £92,000 (2 identical on 16 October 2025)</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>The Transdev case is particularly striking: eleven payments of exactly £11,837.16 to the same bus company on the same day. Either there is a legitimate explanation the council should provide, or public money has been overpaid.</p>\n\n      <h4>2. £10.5 Million to Suppliers Without Contracts</h4>\n\n      <p>Cross-referencing spending data against the council's published contracts register revealed <strong>9 of the top 100 suppliers have no contract on file</strong>:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Beachcroft LLP:</strong> £4.4 million — 6 payments, no contract</li>\n        <li><strong>EDF Energy:</strong> £3.17 million — 127 payments, no contract</li>\n        <li><strong>Harrison Drury Solicitors:</strong> £597,715 — single payment, no contract</li>\n        <li><strong>Forbes Solicitors:</strong> £513,637 — 8 payments, no contract</li>\n        <li><strong>HMRC:</strong> £401,137 — 6 payments (likely legitimate but should appear)</li>\n        <li><strong>Rapid Recruitment:</strong> £399,670 — 666 payments, no contract</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>The Local Government Transparency Code requires councils to publish details of contracts over £5,000. Over £10.5 million flowing to suppliers without published contracts is a transparency failure.</p>\n\n      <h4>3. The Sunday Mystery</h4>\n\n      <p>15 of 18 weekend payments all occurred on a single date: <strong>Sunday 27 November 2022</strong>. This cluster — including £45,982 to Facultatieve Technologies and payments to barristers, recruitment agencies and engineering firms — suggests either a system error or batch processing anomaly that should be investigated.</p>\n\n      <h4>4. Year-End Spending Surge</h4>\n\n      <p>March spending — the last month of the financial year — shows a clear \"use it or lose it\" pattern:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>March 2022: £3.56 million (521 payments)</li>\n        <li>March 2023: £5.41 million (333 payments)</li>\n        <li>March 2024: <strong>£8.18 million</strong> (347 payments) — 2.3x the March 2022 figure</li>\n        <li>March 2025: £2.82 million (383 payments)</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>5. The Q3 2021/22 Anomaly</h4>\n\n      <p>One quarter stands out dramatically: <strong>Q3 2021/22 saw £26.68 million in spending</strong> — 135% above the quarterly average. This was driven by a single £19.85 million <strong>capital programme</strong> payment to Geldards solicitors for the Pioneer Place town centre development. While this exceeds the council's entire annual <em>revenue</em> budget, it's important to note this was capital expenditure funded by borrowing — not day-to-day running costs funded by council tax.</p>\n\n      <h4>Data Integrity Verification</h4>\n\n      <p>We verified our analysis by cross-checking against the council's published CSV files. The duplicates in our system match exactly what the council publishes — we have not introduced any errors. Each quarterly CSV file contains its own date range with no cross-quarter overlaps, confirming the data pipeline is clean.</p>\n\n      <p><em>All figures derived from publicly available Burnley Borough Council spending data published under the Local Government Transparency Code.
