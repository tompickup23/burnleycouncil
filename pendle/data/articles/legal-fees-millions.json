The vast majority of Geldards' payments are <strong>capital programme pass-throughs</strong> for the Pioneer Place town centre development, not legal fees.</p>\n\n      <h4>Understanding the Numbers</h4>\n\n      <p><strong>Critical context:</strong> When a council uses a law firm for a major property or construction transaction, the full payment amount passes through the firm's client account. So a £19.85M payment to Geldards was actually for the Pioneer Place construction project — Geldards' actual legal fee was a small fraction of this.</p>\n\n      <table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;\">\n        <tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);\">\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Law Firm</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:right; padding: 0.5rem;\">Total Payments</th>\n          <th style=\"text-align:left; padding: 0.5rem;\">Context</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td>Geldards LLP</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£20,166,929</td><td><em>Mostly capital programme (Pioneer Place)</em></td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Forbes Solicitors</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£748,228</td><td>Revenue — legal services</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Napthens LLP</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£356,714</td><td>Revenue — legal services</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Weightmans LLP</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£182,453</td><td>Revenue — legal services</td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Shoosmiths LLP</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">£168,337</td><td>Revenue — legal services</td></tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <h4>The Transparency Gap</h4>\n\n      <p>The council's spending data makes <strong>no distinction between a solicitor's fee and a pass-through payment</strong> for a property transaction. This means:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Geldards appears as the council's second-largest \"supplier\" — but they were acting as an intermediary</li>\n        <li>The actual cost of legal services is impossible to determine from the published data</li>\n        <li>Similarly, Beachcroft LLP received £4.4M — likely also including capital programme pass-throughs</li>\n        <li>Revenue-funded legal spending (the genuine legal fees from day-to-day operations) is significantly lower</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>Genuine Legal Spending Questions</h4>\n\n      <p>Setting aside the capital pass-throughs, the council still spends significant sums on revenue-funded legal services:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Are legal panel arrangements competitively tendered?</li>\n        <li>What are the hourly rates being paid to external solicitors?</li>\n        <li>Could some legal work be brought in-house more cheaply?</li>\n        <li>Could the transparency data be improved to separate legal fees from pass-through amounts?</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p><em>All figures are derived from publicly available council spending data.</em></p>\n    "
