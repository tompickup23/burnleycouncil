Burnley is the outlier.</p>\n\n      <h4>The Transparency Code Requirement</h4>\n\n      <p>The <strong>Local Government Transparency Code 2015</strong> requires councils to publish:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>The number of employees whose remuneration exceeds £50,000 in bands of £5,000</li>\n        <li>Senior officer remuneration including salary, expenses, bonuses, compensation for loss of office, and employer pension contributions</li>\n        <li>A pay policy statement showing the relationship between the highest-paid employee and the median salary</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>The purpose of these requirements is to ensure <strong>public transparency over how taxpayer money is used to remunerate senior officials</strong>. When the published data contains apparent contradictions, that transparency objective is undermined.</p>\n\n      <h4>Why This Matters</h4>\n\n      <p>This is not primarily about the amount the Chief Executive is paid. District council chief executives across England earn in the range of £100,000-£150,000, and Burnley's salary level appears consistent with comparable authorities.</p>\n\n      <p>The issue is <strong>transparency and accuracy</strong>:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>If the accounts are correct and no one earned over £100K, the pay policy statement may be misleading</li>\n        <li>If the pay policy is correct and the CE earns £120K+, the accounts disclosure may be incomplete</li>\n        <li>Either way, one of two published official documents appears to be inaccurate</li>\n        <li>Residents and researchers comparing council pay across England would reach the wrong conclusion about Burnley</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h4>The Full Remuneration Picture</h4>\n\n      <p>Salary is only one component of executive remuneration. The full cost to the taxpayer includes:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Basic salary:</strong> The headline pay figure</li>\n        <li><strong>Employer pension contributions:</strong> Typically 15-20% of salary for the Local Government Pension Scheme</li>\n        <li><strong>National Insurance contributions:</strong> Employer NI at 13.8% above the threshold</li>\n        <li><strong>Any allowances or benefits:</strong> Car allowance, telephone, etc.</li>\n        <li><strong>Expenses:</strong> Travel, subsistence, accommodation</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>For a CEO on a salary of £120,000, the total cost to the taxpayer including employer pension and NI contributions could be in the region of <strong>£155,000-£165,000 per year</strong>.</p>\n\n      <h4>Questions That Need Answering</h4>\n\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>How many employees earned over £100,000 including pension contributions in 2023/24?</strong> The gross cost to the taxpayer is what matters.</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the full remuneration package for the Chief Executive?</strong> Salary, pension, NI, allowances, and expenses should all be disclosed.</li>\n        <li><strong>Why does the accounts disclosure differ from the pay policy statement?</strong> A clear explanation for the discrepancy should be published.</li>\n        <li><strong>Has this discrepancy been raised with the external auditors?</strong> If so, what was their view?</li>\n        <li><strong>Is this a one-off or a pattern?</strong> Do previous years' accounts show the same discrepancy?</li>\n        <li><strong>What is the CEO-to-median pay ratio?</strong> The pay policy should disclose this, but is it calculated correctly if the CEO salary is not accurately reflected?</li>\n      </ol>\n\n      <p><em>This article is based on publicly available information including Burnley Borough Council's Pay Policy Statement, Statement of Accounts 2023/24, and the Local Government Transparency Code.
